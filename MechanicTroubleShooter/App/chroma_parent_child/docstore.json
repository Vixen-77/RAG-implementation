They then  deflate immediately so that the passen- gers are not in any way hindered when  leaving the vehicle.\nThe airbag system uses py- rotechnic principles. This  explains why, when the  airbag inflates, it will gener- ate heat, produce smoke (this does  not mean that a fire is about to start)  and make a banging noise. In a situ- ation where an airbag  is required, it  will inflate immediately and this may  cause some minor, superficial graz- ing to the skin or other problems.\nENG_UD47300_1 Dispositifs complémentaires aux ceintures avant (HJD - Dacia) ENG_NU_1271-2_HJD_Dacia_1\nJaune Noir Noir texte\nMETHODS OF RESTRAINT IN ADDITION TO THE FRONT SEAT BELTS  (3/3)\nAll of the warnings below are given so that the  airbag  is not obstructed in any way when it is inflated and also to prevent  the risk of serious injuries caused by items which may be dislodged when it inflates.\nWarnings concerning the driver’s  airbag – Do not modify the steering wheel or the steering wheel boss. – Do not cover the steering wheel boss under any circumstances. – Do not attach any objects (badge, logo, clock, telephone holder, etc.) to the steering wheel boss. – You must not remove the steering wheel (such work must only be performed by trained personnel from our Network). – Do not sit too close to the steering wheel when driving: sit with your arms slightly bent (see “Adjusting your driving position”  in Section 1). This will allow sufficient space for the airbag to deploy correctly and be fully effective.\nWarnings concerning the passenger  airbag – Do not attach or glue any objects (badge, logo, clock, telephone holder, etc.) to the dashboard on or near the airbag. – Do not place anything between the dashboard and the passenger (pet, umbrella, walking stick, parcels, etc.). – The passenger must not put his or her feet on the dashboard or seat as there is a risk that serious injuries may occur. In  general, all parts of the body should be kept away from the dashboard (knees, hands, head etc.). – Reactivate the passenger airbag as soon as you remove the child seat to ensure the protection of the front passenger in the  event of an impact.\nA REAR-FACING CHILD SEAT MUST NOT BE FITTED TO THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT UNLESS  THE RESTRAINT SYSTEMS IN ADDITION TO THE SEAT BELT, I.E.

Incorrect installation compromises the  protection it offers the child in the event  of harsh braking or an impact.\nSet a good example by always fas- tening your seat belt and teaching  your child: – to strap themselves in correctly; – to always get in and out of the car  at the kerb, away from busy traf- fic.\nBefore purchasing a child seat, check  that it complies with the regulations for  the country you are in and that it can  be fitted in your vehicle. Consult an ap- proved dealer to find out which seats  are recommended for your vehicle.\nDo not use a second-hand child  seat or one without an instruction  manual. Check that there are no objects in  the vicinity of the child seat which  could impede its operation.\nNever leave a child unat- tended in the vehicle.\nBefore fitting a child seat, read the  manual and respect its instructions.

Transport the child in this po- sition for as long as possible (until the  age of 2 at the very least). It supports  the head and neck. Choose a bucket  type seat for better side protection and  replace it as soon as the child’s head  extends past the seat shell.\nThe child’s head and abdomen need to  be protected as a priority. A forward-fac- ing child seat which is firmly attached to  the vehicle will reduce the risk of impact  to the head. Ensure your child travels in  a forward-facing seat with a harness for  as long as their size permits. Choose  a wrap-around seat for better side pro- tection.\nFrom 15 kg or 4 years, the child can  travel using a booster seat, which will  enable the seat belt to be adapted  to suit his/her size and shape. The  booster seat cushion must be fitted with  guides to position the seat belt on the  child’s thighs rather than the stomach.  It is recommended that you use a seat- back fitted with a belt strap guide which  can be adjusted in terms of height to  position the seat belt in the centre of  the shoulder. It should never rest on the  neck or over the arm.

Identical for all manufactur- ers, this enables vehicles to be com- pared with one another. Consumption  in real time depends on vehicle usage  conditions, the equipment fitted and the  user’s driving style. To optimise fuel  consumption, please refer to the follow- ing advice.\nDepending on the vehicle, you will have  various functions which enable you to  lower your fuel consumption:\n– gear change indicator;\n–  ECO  mode activated by button  ECO . Gear change indicator  1 To optimise consumption levels, a  warning light on the instrument panel  A   or  B  indicates the best time to move up  or down a gear: Š  move up a gear; ‰  move down a gear.\nENG_UD47328_1 Conseils de conduite, eco conduite (HJD - Dacia) ENG_NU_1271-2_HJD_Dacia_2\nJaune Noir Noir texte\nDRIVING ADVICE, ECO-DRIVING  (2/5)\nActivating the function\nDisabling the  function Press switch  3 .\nThe  2     light goes out on the in- strument panel to confirm deactivation.\nThe  2     warning light comes on on  the instrument panel  A  or  B  to confirm  activation.\nECO  mode is a function which op- timises fuel consumption. It acts on  certain power consuming systems in  the vehicle (heating, air conditioning,  power-assisted steering, etc.) and on  certain driving actions (acceleration,  gear changing, cruise control, deceler- ation, etc.).\nWhile driving, it is possible to leave the  ECO   mode temporarily in order to im- prove engine performance.\nTo do this, press the accelerator pedal  firmly and fully.\nECO  mode is reactivated when you  take pressure off the accelerator pedal.\nLimiting acceleration enables low fuel  consumption in urban and surrounding  areas.

If you an- ticipate an obstacle or bend in ad- vance, you may then simply release  the accelerator pedal. – Do not try to maintain the same  speed up a hill, accelerate no more  than you would on the level. Keep  your foot in the same position on the  accelerator pedal. – Double declutching and accelerating  before switching off are unnecessary  in modern vehicles.\nOn versions with an automatic gear- box, it is preferable to keep the gear  lever in position  D .\nDriving advice and ECO  driving\nOn the driver’s side, only  use mats specially adapted  for the vehicle and attached  to prefitted devices. Check regularly  to make sure they are secure. Do  not overlay several mats.\nRisk of pedals jamming .\n– Drive carefully for the first few miles  until the engine reaches its normal  operating temperature, rather than  let it warm up while the vehicle is sta- tionary. – Speed is expensive. – Sporty driving uses a lot of fuel: drive  with a light right foot. – Do not overrev the engine in the in- termediate gears.   You should always use the highest  gear possible.\nVehicles with    4x4   (4WD) trans- mission On flat, level ground, with the vehi- cle unladen, you are recommended  to start in second gear.\nENG_UD47328_1 Conseils de conduite, eco conduite (HJD - Dacia) ENG_NU_1271-2_HJD_Dacia_2\nJaune Noir Noir texte\nDRIVING ADVICE, ECO-DRIVING  (4/5)\n– An underinflated tyre increases fuel  consumption. – The use of non-recommended tyres  can increase fuel consumption.\n4x2  ( 2WD ) versions\nThe vehicle must not be  used in off-road mode.\nThe label  A  in the vehicle  informs you that your ve- hicle has a higher ground  clearance than an ordinary  passenger vehicle. This gives it a  higher centre of gravity, making it  more susceptible to overturning in  the event of sudden or aggressive  manoeuvres or when cornering  sharply at high speeds. Take extra care when the vehicle is  loaded (in particular when the load  is on the roof). Ensure that all passengers are  wearing their seat belts.\nENG_UD47328_1 Conseils de conduite, eco conduite (HJD - Dacia) ENG_NU_1271-2_HJD_Dacia_2\nJaune Noir Noir texte\nDRIVING ADVICE, ECO-DRIVING  (5/5)\n–  In vehicles fitted with air condi- tioning,  it is normal to observe an  increase in fuel consumption (es- pecially in urban conditions) when  it is used. For vehicles fitted with  manual air conditioning, switch off  the system when it is not required.\nAdvice for reducing consumption  and therefore helping   to   preserve  the environment:\nIf the vehicle has been parked in the  sun, open the doors for a few mo- ments to let the hot air escape before  starting the engine. – Do not leave an empty roof rack  fitted to the vehicle. – It is better to fit a trailer for bulky ob- jects. – When towing a caravan, fit a wind  deflector and adjust it carefully. – Avoid using the car for door-to-door  calls (short journeys with long waits  in between) because the engine  never reaches its normal operating  temperature.\n– Favour the ECO mode. – Electricity is fuel; switch off all the  electrical components which are  not really needed.  However  (safety  first), keep your lights on when the  visibility is bad (“see and be seen”). – Use the air vents. Driving with the  windows open at 60 mph (100 km/h)  will increase fuel consumption by  4%. – Never fill the fuel tank right to the  brim to avoid overflow.\nENG_UD47328_1 Conseils de conduite, eco conduite (HJD - Dacia) ENG_NU_1271-2_HJD_Dacia_2\nJaune Noir Noir texte",

This function ap- plies the brake to any wheel that is slip- ping, allowing the engine torque to be  transferred to the wheels with the most  grip. This is particularly useful when  crossing a bridge.\nAll the ESC functions will be reactivated  when the vehicle speed reaches ap- proximately 30 mph (50 km/h) (36 mph  (60 km/h) in 4WD Lock mode), when  the engine is restarted or when the  “ESC” button is pressed again.\nWhen “4WD Lock\" mode is active, the  ABS switches to off-road mode. In this  case, the wheels may lock intermit- tently to achieve better grip, thus reduc- ing braking distances on soft ground.  When this mode is active: – the vehicle’s manoeuvrability is lim- ited during braking. This operating  mode is therefore not recommended  in very low-grip conditions (eg. ice). – there may be some noise. This is  normal, and does not indicate an op- erating fault.\nENG_UD47333_1 Transmission : 4 roues motrices (4WD) (HJD - Dacia) ENG_NU_1271-2_HJD_Dacia_2\nJaune Noir Noir texte\nTRANSMISSION: 4-wheel drive (4WD)  (4/4)\nAll-wheel drive system\n– Irrespective of the mode selected, do not start the engine if one or more wheels are not in contact with the ground  (eg. when the vehicle is on a jack or roller bench). – Do not turn the mode selector when cornering, reversing or if the wheels are spinning excessively. Only select the  “2WD”, “AUTO” or “4WD Lock” mode when the vehicle is being driven in a straight line. – Only use tyres which meet the required specifications.\n– “4WD Lock” mode is reserved solely for use  off-road.  The use of this mode in any other conditions may adversely affect the  vehicle’s manoeuvrability and damage its mechanical components.\n– Always ensure tyres with identical specifications are fitted to all four wheels (brand, size, structure, wear etc.). Fitting tyres  of different sizes to the front and rear wheels and/or left and right wheels may have serious consequences for the tyres,  gearbox, transfer gearbox and the rear differential pinions.\nENG_UD47333_1 Transmission : 4 roues motrices (4WD) (HJD - Dacia) ENG_NU_1271-2_HJD_Dacia_2\nJaune Noir Noir texte\nDRIVER CORRECTION DEVICES, AIDS  (1/5)\nSpecial feature of 4-wheel drive ve- hicles\nABS (anti-lock braking  system)\nIn 4WD Lock mode, the system may  lock the wheels briefly to optimise the  braking distance on very wet ground  (snow, mud, sand, etc.).\nUnder heavy braking, the ABS prevents  the wheels from locking, allowing the  stopping distance to be managed and  keeping control of the vehicle.\nDepending on the vehicle, this is com- posed of: – the ABS   (anti-lock braking  system); – the emergency brake assist; – electronic stability program   ESC   with understeer control and trac- tion control; – hill start assist; – hill descent control.\nUnder these circumstances, the vehi- cle can be steered to avoid an obstacle  whilst braking. In addition, this system  can increase stopping distances, par- ticularly on roads with low surface grip  (wet ground etc.).\nYou will feel a pulsation through the  brake pedal each time the system is  activated. The ABS does not in any way  improve the vehicle's physical perform- ance relating to the road surface and  roadholding. It is still  essential  to follow  the rules of good driving practice (such  as driving at a safe distance from the  vehicle in front etc.).\nThese functions are an ad- ditional aid in the event of  critical driving conditions,  enabling the vehicle behav- iour to be adapted to suit the driv- ing conditions. The functions do not  take the place of the driver.  They do  not increase the vehicle’s limits  and should not encourage you  to drive more quickly.  Therefore,  they can under no circumstances  replace the vigilance or responsibil- ity of the driver when manoeuvring  the vehicle (the driver must always  be ready for sudden incidents which  may occur when driving).\nIn an emergency, apply  firm and  continuous pressure  to the brake  pedal. There is no need to pump  it repeatedly. The ABS will modu- late the force applied in the braking  system.\nENG_UD52166_2 Dispositifs de correction et d'assistance à la conduite (HJD - Dacia) ENG_NU_1271-2_HJD_Dacia_2\nJaune Noir Noir texte\nDRIVER CORRECTION DEVICES, AIDS  (2/5)\nEmergency brake assist with  electronic brake distribution (depending on the vehicle)\nThis system supplements the ABS  and helps reduce vehicle stopping dis- tances.\n–  ©  and  x  lit up on the in- strument panel accompanied by the  messages “Check ABS”, “Check  braking system” and “Check ESC”:  this indicates that the ABS, the ESC  and the emergency brake assist are  disabled.

You  must make sure that your tyres con-  form to local road traffic regulations.\nWhen the tyre tread has been worn  to the level of the warning strips,  they  become visible  2 : it is  then  neces- sary to replace your tyres because the  tread rubber is now only  1.6 mm deep  at most, resulting in poor road hold- ing on wet roads.\nFor your safety, please re- spect the speed limit.\nAn overloaded vehicle, long journeys  by motorway, particularly in very hot  weather, or continual driving on poorly  surfaced minor roads will lead to more  rapid tyre wear and affect safety.\nWhen they need to be re- placed, only tyres of the  same make, size, type and profile  should be used on a single axle.\nMaintaining the tyres\nThey must: either have a load ca- pacity and a speed capacity at  least equal to the original tyres,  or correspond to those recom- mended by your authorised  dealer.\nThe tyres must be in good condition  and the tread form must have sufficient  depth; tyres approved by our Technical  Department have wear warning strips  1   which are  indicators moulded into  the tread at several points.\nFailure to heed these instructions  could endanger your safety and  affect your vehicle’s roadworthi- ness.\nRisk of loss of control of the ve- hicle.\nIncidents which occur when  driving, such as striking the  kerb, may damage the tyres  and wheel rims, and could  also lead to misalignment of the  front or rear axle geometry. If such  incidents occur, have the condition  of these parts checked by an ap- proved dealer.\nENG_UD52045_2 Pneumatiques (HJD - Dacia) ENG_NU_1271-2_HJD_Dacia_5\nJaune Noir Noir texte\nPressures should be checked when the  tyres are cold; ignore higher pressures  which may be reached in hot weather  or following a fast journey. If tyre pressures cannot be checked  when the tyres are  cold , assume an in- crease of  0.2  to  0.3  bar.\nAdhere to the tyre pressures (including  the emergency spare wheel). The tyre  pressures should be checked at least  once a month and additionally before  any long journey (refer to the label af- fixed to the edge of the driver’s door).\nNever deflate a hot tyre.\nSpecial note Depending on the vehicle, there may  be an adapter which needs to be posi- tioned on the valve before air is added.\nIncorrect tyre pressures   lead to abnormal tyre wear  and unusually hot running.  These are factors which  may seriously affect safety and lead  to:\n– risk of blowouts or throwing a  tread.\nPlease be aware that a  poorly tightened or miss- ing valve cap can make the  tyres less airtight and may  lead to pressure loss.\nThe tyre pressure depends on the  load and speed of use; adjust the  pressures according to the condi- tions of use (refer to the information  on “Tyre pressures” in Section 4).\nAlways use valve caps which are  identical to the originals.\nYour vehicle is equipped with large  wheels. These are more sensitive  to imbalance.

We recommend that the maximum load be reduced by  10% at an altitude of 1,000 metres and by an additional 10% for each 1,000 metres thereafter. Weight transfer ( 4x2  versions only) If the Maximum Authorised Mass of the vehicle has not been reached, up to 300 kg can be transferred to the braked trailer, within  the limits of the Gross Train Weight.\nENG_UD47397_1 Masses/Charges remorquables (HJD - Dacia) ENG_NU_1271-2_HJD_Dacia_6\nJaune Noir Noir texte",
