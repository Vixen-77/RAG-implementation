They then  deflate immediately so that the passen- gers are not in any way hindered when  leaving the vehicle.\nThe airbag system uses py- rotechnic principles. This  explains why, when the  airbag inflates, it will gener- ate heat, produce smoke (this does  not mean that a fire is about to start)  and make a banging noise. In a situ- ation where an airbag  is required, it  will inflate immediately and this may  cause some minor, superficial graz- ing to the skin or other problems.\nENG_UD47300_1 Dispositifs complémentaires aux ceintures avant (HJD - Dacia) ENG_NU_1271-2_HJD_Dacia_1\nJaune Noir Noir texte\nMETHODS OF RESTRAINT IN ADDITION TO THE FRONT SEAT BELTS  (3/3)\nAll of the warnings below are given so that the  airbag  is not obstructed in any way when it is inflated and also to prevent  the risk of serious injuries caused by items which may be dislodged when it inflates.\nWarnings concerning the driver’s  airbag – Do not modify the steering wheel or the steering wheel boss. – Do not cover the steering wheel boss under any circumstances. – Do not attach any objects (badge, logo, clock, telephone holder, etc.) to the steering wheel boss. – You must not remove the steering wheel (such work must only be performed by trained personnel from our Network). – Do not sit too close to the steering wheel when driving: sit with your arms slightly bent (see “Adjusting your driving position”  in Section 1). This will allow sufficient space for the airbag to deploy correctly and be fully effective.\nWarnings concerning the passenger  airbag – Do not attach or glue any objects (badge, logo, clock, telephone holder, etc.) to the dashboard on or near the airbag. – Do not place anything between the dashboard and the passenger (pet, umbrella, walking stick, parcels, etc.). – The passenger must not put his or her feet on the dashboard or seat as there is a risk that serious injuries may occur. In  general, all parts of the body should be kept away from the dashboard (knees, hands, head etc.). – Reactivate the passenger airbag as soon as you remove the child seat to ensure the protection of the front passenger in the  event of an impact.\nA REAR-FACING CHILD SEAT MUST NOT BE FITTED TO THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT UNLESS  THE RESTRAINT SYSTEMS IN ADDITION TO THE SEAT BELT, I.E.

Incorrect installation compromises the  protection it offers the child in the event  of harsh braking or an impact.\nSet a good example by always fas- tening your seat belt and teaching  your child: – to strap themselves in correctly; – to always get in and out of the car  at the kerb, away from busy traf- fic.\nBefore purchasing a child seat, check  that it complies with the regulations for  the country you are in and that it can  be fitted in your vehicle. Consult an ap- proved dealer to find out which seats  are recommended for your vehicle.\nDo not use a second-hand child  seat or one without an instruction  manual. Check that there are no objects in  the vicinity of the child seat which  could impede its operation.\nNever leave a child unat- tended in the vehicle.\nBefore fitting a child seat, read the  manual and respect its instructions.

Transport the child in this po- sition for as long as possible (until the  age of 2 at the very least). It supports  the head and neck. Choose a bucket  type seat for better side protection and  replace it as soon as the child’s head  extends past the seat shell.\nThe child’s head and abdomen need to  be protected as a priority. A forward-fac- ing child seat which is firmly attached to  the vehicle will reduce the risk of impact  to the head. Ensure your child travels in  a forward-facing seat with a harness for  as long as their size permits. Choose  a wrap-around seat for better side pro- tection.\nFrom 15 kg or 4 years, the child can  travel using a booster seat, which will  enable the seat belt to be adapted  to suit his/her size and shape. The  booster seat cushion must be fitted with  guides to position the seat belt on the  child’s thighs rather than the stomach.  It is recommended that you use a seat- back fitted with a belt strap guide which  can be adjusted in terms of height to  position the seat belt in the centre of  the shoulder. It should never rest on the  neck or over the arm.

Identical for all manufactur- ers, this enables vehicles to be com- pared with one another. Consumption  in real time depends on vehicle usage  conditions, the equipment fitted and the  user’s driving style. To optimise fuel  consumption, please refer to the follow- ing advice.\nDepending on the vehicle, you will have  various functions which enable you to  lower your fuel consumption:\n– gear change indicator;\n–  ECO  mode activated by button  ECO . Gear change indicator  1 To optimise consumption levels, a  warning light on the instrument panel  A   or  B  indicates the best time to move up  or down a gear: Š  move up a gear; ‰  move down a gear.\nENG_UD47328_1 Conseils de conduite, eco conduite (HJD - Dacia) ENG_NU_1271-2_HJD_Dacia_2\nJaune Noir Noir texte\nDRIVING ADVICE, ECO-DRIVING  (2/5)\nActivating the function\nDisabling the  function Press switch  3 .\nThe  2     light goes out on the in- strument panel to confirm deactivation.\nThe  2     warning light comes on on  the instrument panel  A  or  B  to confirm  activation.\nECO  mode is a function which op- timises fuel consumption. It acts on  certain power consuming systems in  the vehicle (heating, air conditioning,  power-assisted steering, etc.) and on  certain driving actions (acceleration,  gear changing, cruise control, deceler- ation, etc.).\nWhile driving, it is possible to leave the  ECO   mode temporarily in order to im- prove engine performance.\nTo do this, press the accelerator pedal  firmly and fully.\nECO  mode is reactivated when you  take pressure off the accelerator pedal.\nLimiting acceleration enables low fuel  consumption in urban and surrounding  areas.

If you an- ticipate an obstacle or bend in ad- vance, you may then simply release  the accelerator pedal. – Do not try to maintain the same  speed up a hill, accelerate no more  than you would on the level. Keep  your foot in the same position on the  accelerator pedal. – Double declutching and accelerating  before switching off are unnecessary  in modern vehicles.\nOn versions with an automatic gear- box, it is preferable to keep the gear  lever in position  D .\nDriving advice and ECO  driving\nOn the driver’s side, only  use mats specially adapted  for the vehicle and attached  to prefitted devices. Check regularly  to make sure they are secure. Do  not overlay several mats.\nRisk of pedals jamming .\n– Drive carefully for the first few miles  until the engine reaches its normal  operating temperature, rather than  let it warm up while the vehicle is sta- tionary. – Speed is expensive. – Sporty driving uses a lot of fuel: drive  with a light right foot. – Do not overrev the engine in the in- termediate gears.   You should always use the highest  gear possible.\nVehicles with    4x4   (4WD) trans- mission On flat, level ground, with the vehi- cle unladen, you are recommended  to start in second gear.\nENG_UD47328_1 Conseils de conduite, eco conduite (HJD - Dacia) ENG_NU_1271-2_HJD_Dacia_2\nJaune Noir Noir texte\nDRIVING ADVICE, ECO-DRIVING  (4/5)\n– An underinflated tyre increases fuel  consumption. – The use of non-recommended tyres  can increase fuel consumption.\n4x2  ( 2WD ) versions\nThe vehicle must not be  used in off-road mode.\nThe label  A  in the vehicle  informs you that your ve- hicle has a higher ground  clearance than an ordinary  passenger vehicle. This gives it a  higher centre of gravity, making it  more susceptible to overturning in  the event of sudden or aggressive  manoeuvres or when cornering  sharply at high speeds. Take extra care when the vehicle is  loaded (in particular when the load  is on the roof). Ensure that all passengers are  wearing their seat belts.\nENG_UD47328_1 Conseils de conduite, eco conduite (HJD - Dacia) ENG_NU_1271-2_HJD_Dacia_2\nJaune Noir Noir texte\nDRIVING ADVICE, ECO-DRIVING  (5/5)\n–  In vehicles fitted with air condi- tioning,  it is normal to observe an  increase in fuel consumption (es- pecially in urban conditions) when  it is used. For vehicles fitted with  manual air conditioning, switch off  the system when it is not required.\nAdvice for reducing consumption  and therefore helping   to   preserve  the environment:\nIf the vehicle has been parked in the  sun, open the doors for a few mo- ments to let the hot air escape before  starting the engine. – Do not leave an empty roof rack  fitted to the vehicle. – It is better to fit a trailer for bulky ob- jects. – When towing a caravan, fit a wind  deflector and adjust it carefully. – Avoid using the car for door-to-door  calls (short journeys with long waits  in between) because the engine  never reaches its normal operating  temperature.\n– Favour the ECO mode. – Electricity is fuel; switch off all the  electrical components which are  not really needed.  However  (safety  first), keep your lights on when the  visibility is bad (“see and be seen”). – Use the air vents. Driving with the  windows open at 60 mph (100 km/h)  will increase fuel consumption by  4%. – Never fill the fuel tank right to the  brim to avoid overflow.\nENG_UD47328_1 Conseils de conduite, eco conduite (HJD - Dacia) ENG_NU_1271-2_HJD_Dacia_2\nJaune Noir Noir texte",

This function ap- plies the brake to any wheel that is slip- ping, allowing the engine torque to be  transferred to the wheels with the most  grip. This is particularly useful when  crossing a bridge.\nAll the ESC functions will be reactivated  when the vehicle speed reaches ap- proximately 30 mph (50 km/h) (36 mph  (60 km/h) in 4WD Lock mode), when  the engine is restarted or when the  “ESC” button is pressed again.\nWhen “4WD Lock\" mode is active, the  ABS switches to off-road mode. In this  case, the wheels may lock intermit- tently to achieve better grip, thus reduc- ing braking distances on soft ground.  When this mode is active: – the vehicle’s manoeuvrability is lim- ited during braking. This operating  mode is therefore not recommended  in very low-grip conditions (eg. ice). – there may be some noise. This is  normal, and does not indicate an op- erating fault.\nENG_UD47333_1 Transmission : 4 roues motrices (4WD) (HJD - Dacia) ENG_NU_1271-2_HJD_Dacia_2\nJaune Noir Noir texte\nTRANSMISSION: 4-wheel drive (4WD)  (4/4)\nAll-wheel drive system\n– Irrespective of the mode selected, do not start the engine if one or more wheels are not in contact with the ground  (eg. when the vehicle is on a jack or roller bench). – Do not turn the mode selector when cornering, reversing or if the wheels are spinning excessively. Only select the  “2WD”, “AUTO” or “4WD Lock” mode when the vehicle is being driven in a straight line. – Only use tyres which meet the required specifications.\n– “4WD Lock” mode is reserved solely for use  off-road.  The use of this mode in any other conditions may adversely affect the  vehicle’s manoeuvrability and damage its mechanical components.\n– Always ensure tyres with identical specifications are fitted to all four wheels (brand, size, structure, wear etc.). Fitting tyres  of different sizes to the front and rear wheels and/or left and right wheels may have serious consequences for the tyres,  gearbox, transfer gearbox and the rear differential pinions.\nENG_UD47333_1 Transmission : 4 roues motrices (4WD) (HJD - Dacia) ENG_NU_1271-2_HJD_Dacia_2\nJaune Noir Noir texte\nDRIVER CORRECTION DEVICES, AIDS  (1/5)\nSpecial feature of 4-wheel drive ve- hicles\nABS (anti-lock braking  system)\nIn 4WD Lock mode, the system may  lock the wheels briefly to optimise the  braking distance on very wet ground  (snow, mud, sand, etc.).\nUnder heavy braking, the ABS prevents  the wheels from locking, allowing the  stopping distance to be managed and  keeping control of the vehicle.\nDepending on the vehicle, this is com- posed of: – the ABS   (anti-lock braking  system); – the emergency brake assist; – electronic stability program   ESC   with understeer control and trac- tion control; – hill start assist; – hill descent control.\nUnder these circumstances, the vehi- cle can be steered to avoid an obstacle  whilst braking. In addition, this system  can increase stopping distances, par- ticularly on roads with low surface grip  (wet ground etc.).\nYou will feel a pulsation through the  brake pedal each time the system is  activated. The ABS does not in any way  improve the vehicle's physical perform- ance relating to the road surface and  roadholding. It is still  essential  to follow  the rules of good driving practice (such  as driving at a safe distance from the  vehicle in front etc.).\nThese functions are an ad- ditional aid in the event of  critical driving conditions,  enabling the vehicle behav- iour to be adapted to suit the driv- ing conditions. The functions do not  take the place of the driver.  They do  not increase the vehicle’s limits  and should not encourage you  to drive more quickly.  Therefore,  they can under no circumstances  replace the vigilance or responsibil- ity of the driver when manoeuvring  the vehicle (the driver must always  be ready for sudden incidents which  may occur when driving).\nIn an emergency, apply  firm and  continuous pressure  to the brake  pedal. There is no need to pump  it repeatedly. The ABS will modu- late the force applied in the braking  system.\nENG_UD52166_2 Dispositifs de correction et d'assistance à la conduite (HJD - Dacia) ENG_NU_1271-2_HJD_Dacia_2\nJaune Noir Noir texte\nDRIVER CORRECTION DEVICES, AIDS  (2/5)\nEmergency brake assist with  electronic brake distribution (depending on the vehicle)\nThis system supplements the ABS  and helps reduce vehicle stopping dis- tances.\n–  ©  and  x  lit up on the in- strument panel accompanied by the  messages “Check ABS”, “Check  braking system” and “Check ESC”:  this indicates that the ABS, the ESC  and the emergency brake assist are  disabled.

You  must make sure that your tyres con-  form to local road traffic regulations.\nWhen the tyre tread has been worn  to the level of the warning strips,  they  become visible  2 : it is  then  neces- sary to replace your tyres because the  tread rubber is now only  1.6 mm deep  at most, resulting in poor road hold- ing on wet roads.\nFor your safety, please re- spect the speed limit.\nAn overloaded vehicle, long journeys  by motorway, particularly in very hot  weather, or continual driving on poorly  surfaced minor roads will lead to more  rapid tyre wear and affect safety.\nWhen they need to be re- placed, only tyres of the  same make, size, type and profile  should be used on a single axle.\nMaintaining the tyres\nThey must: either have a load ca- pacity and a speed capacity at  least equal to the original tyres,  or correspond to those recom- mended by your authorised  dealer.\nThe tyres must be in good condition  and the tread form must have sufficient  depth; tyres approved by our Technical  Department have wear warning strips  1   which are  indicators moulded into  the tread at several points.\nFailure to heed these instructions  could endanger your safety and  affect your vehicle’s roadworthi- ness.\nRisk of loss of control of the ve- hicle.\nIncidents which occur when  driving, such as striking the  kerb, may damage the tyres  and wheel rims, and could  also lead to misalignment of the  front or rear axle geometry. If such  incidents occur, have the condition  of these parts checked by an ap- proved dealer.\nENG_UD52045_2 Pneumatiques (HJD - Dacia) ENG_NU_1271-2_HJD_Dacia_5\nJaune Noir Noir texte\nPressures should be checked when the  tyres are cold; ignore higher pressures  which may be reached in hot weather  or following a fast journey. If tyre pressures cannot be checked  when the tyres are  cold , assume an in- crease of  0.2  to  0.3  bar.\nAdhere to the tyre pressures (including  the emergency spare wheel). The tyre  pressures should be checked at least  once a month and additionally before  any long journey (refer to the label af- fixed to the edge of the driver’s door).\nNever deflate a hot tyre.\nSpecial note Depending on the vehicle, there may  be an adapter which needs to be posi- tioned on the valve before air is added.\nIncorrect tyre pressures   lead to abnormal tyre wear  and unusually hot running.  These are factors which  may seriously affect safety and lead  to:\n– risk of blowouts or throwing a  tread.\nPlease be aware that a  poorly tightened or miss- ing valve cap can make the  tyres less airtight and may  lead to pressure loss.\nThe tyre pressure depends on the  load and speed of use; adjust the  pressures according to the condi- tions of use (refer to the information  on “Tyre pressures” in Section 4).\nAlways use valve caps which are  identical to the originals.\nYour vehicle is equipped with large  wheels. These are more sensitive  to imbalance.

We recommend that the maximum load be reduced by  10% at an altitude of 1,000 metres and by an additional 10% for each 1,000 metres thereafter. Weight transfer ( 4x2  versions only) If the Maximum Authorised Mass of the vehicle has not been reached, up to 300 kg can be transferred to the braked trailer, within  the limits of the Gross Train Weight.\nENG_UD47397_1 Masses/Charges remorquables (HJD - Dacia) ENG_NU_1271-2_HJD_Dacia_6\nJaune Noir Noir texte",

Please read them carefully in order to reduce the risk of injury, and avoid using incorrect procedures that could damage the vehicle or make it dangerous to use.\nThe repair procedures have been designed using spe- cial tools; they must therefore be carried out using the- se tools to ensure a high degree of working safety and quality of repair.\nThe equipment we have approved has undergone ca- reful research and testing, and must be used and main- tained with care.\nFollowing the recommended procedures will help you to provide a quality of service which will ensure the ve- hicles achieve the highest levels of performance and reliability.\nENGINE AND LOWER ENGINE ASSEMBLY Engine: Precautions for repair 10A\nMaintenance and repair operations must be carried out under the proper conditions to ensure that our vehicles run safely and reliably.\nThe use of rags or ordinary paper towels is prohibited: these produce lint and lose fibres, which then contami- nate the fuel circuit.\nEach cloth must only be used once.\nRisks relating to contamination\nThe blanking plugs are used to cap the fuel circuit once it is opened and to therefore prevent contaminants from entering.\nThe high-pressure direct injection system is highly sen- sitive to contamination. The risks caused by contami- nation are:\n- damage to or destruction of the high-pressure injec- tion system,\n- a component seizing,\nA set of blanking plugs should be used once only and used plugs must be discarded after use: once used, the plugs are soiled and cleaning them is not sufficient to make them reusable.\n- a component not being properly sealed.\nUnused plugs must also be discarded and not used again for any other operation on an injection system.\nBlanking plug kit part number:\nAll After-Sales operations must be performed under very clean conditions. Having carried out an operation in good conditions means that no impurities (particles a few microns in size) have penetrated the system during dismantling.\n- K9K (  DELPHI  injection):  77 01 206 804\n- K9K (  SIEMENS  injection):  77 01 476 857\nThe cleanliness principle must be applied from the filter to the injectors.\nWhat are the sources of contamination?\n- metal or plastic chips,\nUse hermetically resealable plastic bags, using adhesi- ve tape, for example, to store components which will be refitted and reused. Stored parts will therefore be less subject to the risk of contamination.\nThese bags must be used once only: once they have been used, they are to be discarded.\nd - Cleaning products\nTwo cleaning products can be used:\n- foreign bodies such as hair,\n- ambient atmosphere,\n- an aerosol spray brake cleaner (part number  77 11 226 128  ).\n- an injector cleaner (part number  77 11 224 188  ),\nTo use the injector cleaner, be sure to have a clean brush in good condition (the brush must not lose any bristles) as well as a clean container which has no im- purities in it.\nCleaning the engine using a high-pressure washer is prohibited because of the risk of damaging con- nections. In addition, moisture may collect in the connectors and create electrical connection faults.\nUse a new injector cleaner each time work is car- ried out (a used cleaning agent will contain impuri- ties).\nUse lint free cleaning cloths (part number  77 11 211 707  ).\nENGINE AND LOWER ENGINE ASSEMBLY Engine: Precautions for repair 10A\nIII - GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS\n1 - Advice to be followed before any operation\nAfter opening the fuel circuit, the use of brushes, clea- ning agents, air blow guns, rifle-type brushes or stan- dard cloths is strictly prohibited: These items are likely to allow impurities to enter the system.\nWhen replacing a component with a new one or when refitting it after storing it in a plastic bag, do not unpack it until it is time to fit it on the vehicle.\n1) Carry out the work in a clean working area and take care to protect removed components from dust using plastic bags which are hermetically resealable, for example.\n2) Always order the following from the Parts Depart- ment before carrying out work:\n-   a new blanking plug kit  ; these are specific to the engine\nThere are currently two procedures for cleaning the fuel circuit before opening it in order to carry out work in the workshop.\n- a sufficient number of lint free  cleaning cloths  .\n- one of the two  cleaning products  for fuel pipe unions,\nThese procedures enable the fuel circuit to be cleaned to prevent contamination from entering: they both have the same end result and neither is preferred over the other.\na - Using the injector cleaning agent\n-   the parts always to be replaced  after each removal operation mentioned in the operational procedures specific to the vehicle.\n3) Wear safety goggles fitted with side shields to pre- vent the cleaning product from splashing the eyes.\nClear the access to the unions that need opening, fol- lowing the work procedures specific to the vehicle (see the relevant Workshop Repair Manual).\n4) Wear latex safety gloves to avoid prolonged contact with the skin.\nProtect sections which are sensitive to fuel leaks.\nPour the injector cleaning agent into a container which is free from impurities.\nIf wearing leather protective gloves, cover these with latex gloves. IMPORTANT\nWear latex safety gloves when using the cleaning agent.\n5) Before any operation on the injection system, using  plastic bags or clean cloths, protect:\n- the accessories and timing belts,\nDip a clean brush, which is not shedding bristles, into the container of injector cleaning agent.\n- the electrical accessories (starter, alternator, power- assisted steering pump, sensors and electrical con- nectors),\nWear safety goggles ﬁtted with side shields during this operation.\n2 - Instructions to be followed during the operation\nClean the unions carefully using the brush and the in- jector cleaning agent.\nWash your hands before and while carrying out the work.\nChange the latex safety gloves if they become soiled or damaged.\nBlast the components that have been cleaned with compressed air (tools, workbench, and also parts, unions and around the injection system). Make sure there are no brush bristles remaining and that the area is clean.\nAll components removed from the injection system must be stored in a hermetically sealed plastic bag once they have been capped.\nWipe the sections that were cleaned with fresh clea- ning cloths.\nOpen the circuit at the unions and immediately fit the relevant blanking plugs.\nReseal the bag hermetically using adhesive tape, for example, even if the bag must be opened shortly afte- rwards: ambient air can be a source of pollution.\nENGINE AND LOWER ENGINE ASSEMBLY Engine: Precautions for repair 10A\nDo not blast with compressed air once the fuel cir- cuit is open, otherwise impurities may enter the sys- tem. Use cleaning cloths only, if necessary.\nb - Using the brake cleaning agent\nClear the access to the unions that need opening, fol- lowing the work procedures specific to the vehicle (see the relevant Workshop Repair Manual).\nProtect sections which are sensitive to fuel leaks.\nWear latex safety gloves when using the cleaning agent.\nWear safety goggles ﬁtted with side shields during this operation.\nSpray the brake cleaning agent onto the unions to be opened.\nClean the unions carefully using fresh cleaning cloths.\nBlast the components that have been cleaned with compressed air (tools, workbench, and also parts, unions and around the injection system). Make sure there are no brush bristles remaining and that the area is clean.\nOpen the circuit at the unions and immediately fit the relevant blanking plugs.\nDo not blast with compressed air once the fuel cir- cuit is open, otherwise impurities may enter the sys- tem.

as an excep- tion, the vehicle can be towed with the wheels on the ground, but at a speed of less than 12 mph (20 km/h) over a maximum distance of  18 miles (30 km)  (with the gear lever in neutral).\n1 - Position of front attachment point\nAppropriate axle stands must be used if a trolley jack is used.\nThe subframe of this vehicle is protected by prod- ucts providing a  6-year  anti-corrosion warranty.\nNever use equipment not ﬁtted with rubber pads, to avoid direct metal to metal contact which could damage the original protection.\nThe vehicle must not be raised by support points under the front suspension arms or under the rear axle.\nLIFTING EQUIPMENT Vehicle: Towing and lifting 02A\nIII - LIFTING ON A LIFT\n1 - Safety advice reminder\nIf it is necessary to remove heavy components from the vehicle, it is preferable to use a four-post lift.\nAfter removing certain components (e.g. engine and transmission assembly, rear axle, fuel tank, etc.), there is a danger that the vehicle will tip on a two post lift.\nTo raise a front or rear wheel, use ( 1 ) as the support point.\nWhen the vehicle is raised on an underbody two post lift, fit  safety strap(s) , part no.  77 11 172 554  available from the Parts Department.\nTo mount the vehicle on axle stands, the entire vehicle must be lifted on one side and axle stands must be placed under the jacking points for the tool kit jack ( 1 ) .\nLIFTING EQUIPMENT Vehicle: Towing and lifting 02A\n2 - Fitting the straps\nOnly the jacking points described in this section allow the vehicle to be raised in complete safety.\nDo not raise the vehicle using points other than those described in this section.\nFor safety purposes, the straps must always be in per- fect condition; replace them if they are damaged.\nPosition the lift arms under the end of the sill panel body flanges.\nWhen fitting the straps, check that the seats and fragile parts of the vehicle are correctly protected.\na - Tilting towards the front\nPass the strap under the rear right-hand arm of the lift.\nPass the strap through the inside of the vehicle.\nPass the strap under the rear left-hand arm of the lift.\nPass the belt through the inside of the vehicle again.\nb - Tilting towards the rear\nPass the strap under the front right-hand arm of the lift.\nPass the strap through the inside of the vehicle.\nPosition the lift arms under the end of the sill panel body flanges.\nPass the strap under the front left-hand arm of the lift.\nPass the belt through the inside of the vehicle again.\n3 - Permitted jacking points\nTo raise the vehicle, position the pads of the lift arms as indicated below taking care not to damage the end of the front wing or the underside of the sill panel.\nCOLLISION Vehicle involved in an impact: Impact fault finding 03B\nI - CHECKING THE SUBFRAME\nChronological order of checks\nCompare the following distances between diagonal- ly opposite points:\n- 1: B1 - G2 = B2 - G1\n- 2: G1 - C2 = G2 - C1\nCompare the following distances between diagonal- ly opposite points\n- 1: G2 - B1 = G1 - B2\n- 2: B1 - J2 = B2 - J1\nCOLLISION Vehicle involved in an impact: Impact fault finding 03B\nII - DETAILED VIEW OF INSPECTION POINTS\nCONSUMABLES - PRODUCTS Vehicle: Parts and consumables for the repair 04B\nConsumables for mechanical repair:",

When replacing components in a vehi- cle's braking circuit, always mark the pipes before removing them.\nGENERAL INFORMATION Brake circuit: Precautions for the repair 30A\n1 - Advice to be followed before any operation\nPrepare for the ﬂow of ﬂuid, and protect the sur- rounding components.\nFor an operation requiring the use of a lift, follow the safety advice (see  Vehicle: Towing and lifting ) (02A, Lifting equipment).\nDo not allow friction materials to come into contact with grease, oil or other lubricants and cleaning products which are mineral oil based.\nThe brake regulation circuit must be free of all hydrau- lic and electrical faults.\nIII - GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS\nWhen replacing brake pads, always replace the pads on the other side as well.\nIn case of incorrect handling, the brake fluid can cause serious injury and damage. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for brake fluid.\nWhen replacing a disc, always replace the disc on the opposite side.\nTo prevent dust from entering the master cylinder res- ervoir and the brake circuit, the plug must be removed just before filling and closed immediately afterwards,\nWhen replacing brake discs, you must replace the brake pads.\n2 - Instructions to be followed during the operation\nDo not press on the brake pedal during work on the brake system.\nIn order not to damage the brake hose:\n- do not tension the hose,\n- do not twist the hose,\nIf, during work on the brake system, any damage on any part is observed, it must be repaired before driving the vehicle again.\nBrake fluid is highly corrosive. Ensure any brake fluid spilt on parts of the vehicle is cleaned off.\n- check that there is no contact with the surrounding components, regardless of the position of the wheels.\nUse brake fluids that comply with the Renault standard (see  Vehicle: Parts and consumables for the repair ) .\nCheck the brake fluid levels in the braking circuit and the bleeding device.\nTo avoid any accident, bring the pistons, brake pads and brake discs into contact by depressing the brake pad several times.\nCheck that the pressure of the bleeding device is be- tween  1.5 bar and 2 bar .\nAlways replace the rigid brake pipe clips.\n- The pipes between the master cylinder, callipers and the hydraulic assembly are connected using threaded unions with a metric thread.\n1 - Advice to be followed before any operation\n- Therefore, only parts specified in the Parts Catalogue for this vehicle should be used.\nProtect any bodywork components that risk being dam- aged by brake fluid with a cover.\n2 - Instructions to be followed during the operation\nFit blanking plugs recommended for the Siemens K9K injection system at the end of each pipe and in all the openings of the disconnected components of the brake circuit.\nClean around the braking system with  BRAKE CLEANER   (see  Vehicle: Parts and consumables for the repair ) (04B, Consumables - Products).\nGENERAL INFORMATION Brake circuit: Precautions for the repair 30A\nParts identification:\n- shape of steel or copper pipe end piece (A),\n- shape of connecting points on components (B),\n- shape of unions (C):  11 mm  hexagonal.\nPrecautions to be taken before and during the brake circuit bleeding operation:\n- use brake fluid which conforms to the Renault stan- dard (see  Vehicle: Parts and consumables for the repair ) (04B, Consumables - Products),\n- check the brake fluid levels in the brake circuit and the bleeding device,\n- the braking regulation circuit must be free from all hy- draulic and electrical faults,\n- check that the pressure of the bleeding device is be- tween  1.5 bars and 2 bars .\nGENERAL INFORMATION Braking circuit: Bleed 30A\nbrake circuit bleeding device\nTo avoid all risk of damage to the systems, apply the safety and cleanliness instructions and opera- tion recommendations before carrying out any repair (see  30A ,  General information ,  Brake cir- cuit: Precautions for the repair , page  30A-2 ) .\nThis procedure must be applied after one of the fol- lowing components has been removed or replaced:\n- the master cylinder,\n- the hydraulic unit,\na  Use locally produced containers to collect the used brake fluid.\nFront and rear callipers:\n- 2 washer fluid containers ( 1 ) (1 litre),\n-  4 mm  diameter transparent pipes ( 2 ) ,\nSwitch off the vehicle ignition so as not to activate the hydraulic unit solenoid valves when bleeding the brake circuit.\nThe new hydraulic unit is pre-ﬁlled.\nThe level must be between the « MIN » and « MAX » markings on the reservoir.\nWhen working on one of the following compo- nents, position a  pedal press  to limit the outﬂow  of brake ﬂuid and prevent any air from entering  the master cylinder and the circuits downstream  of the master cylinder:\n- pipes between the hydraulic unit and brake cal- lipers,\nRemove the  pedal press  before carrying out the braking system bleeding procedure.\na  Position the vehicle on a two-post lift (see  Vehicle: Towing and lifting ) (02A, Lifting equipment).\na  Switch off the vehicle ignition.\nGENERAL INFORMATION Braking circuit: Bleed 30A\na  Remove the  brake circuit bleeding device  from the master cylinder reservoir.\na  Connect the  brake circuit bleeding device  (after having received Renault approval) to the master cyl- inder reservoir (see the instructions for the equip- ment).\na  Pressurise the brake circuit.\na  Check pedal travel and resistance.

    "page_content": "Our braking technology, and in particular the disc brakes (hollow pistons which conduct little heat, have a low volume of fluid in the cylinder, sliding callipers avoiding the need for a fluid reserve in the least cooled area of the wheel), has allowed us to prevent the risk of « vapour lock » as far as possible, even with heavy braking (mountainous area). However, current brake fluids are subject to minor deterioration during the first months of use due to slight humidity intake. This is why it is recommended that you change the brake fluid: see maintenance booklet for the vehicle .\n1 - Topping up the level\nWear of the brake pads will result in a gradual drop in the fluid level in the reservoir.\nDo not top up the fluid, as the level will rise again when the pads are next changed. The brake fluid level must not fall below the minimum mark.\n2 - Approved brake fluid\nMixing two incompatible brake fluids in the brake circuit  may lead to:\n- serious risk of leakage due mainly to deterioration of the cups,\n- deterioration in the operation of the ESP system.\nTo prevent such risks, it is essential to use only brake fluids that comply with the RENAULT standard (see Vehicle: Parts and consumables for the repair ) .\nGENERAL INFORMATION Brake: Specifications 30A\nDisc diameter 280 269\nMinimum disc thickness (1) 21.8 19.8\nMaximum disc run-out 0.07\nBrake lining thickness (including backplate) 17.8 17.4\nMinimum brake lining thickness (including backplate) 7.5 8.1\nMaximum drum wear diameter 229.5\nThickness of primary brake lining 4.9\nThickness of secondary brake lining 4.9\n(1) Brake discs cannot be reground.

Ensure any brake fluid spilt on parts of the vehicle is cleaned off.\nProtect any bodywork components that risk being dam- aged by brake fluid with a cover.\nTo prevent the suspension spring from prematurely breaking, do not damage the anti-corrosion protec- tion.\nIn the interests of safety, do not leave a spring com- pressed in the spring compressor tool.\nClean around the braking system with  BRAKE CLEANER   (see  Vehicle: Parts and consumables for the repair ) (04B, Consumables - Products).\nThe shock absorber mountings are only to be tightened with the vehicle wheels on the ground.\nPrepare for the ﬂow of ﬂuid, and protect the sur- rounding components.\nAlways replace the shock absorber upper mounting nut.\nIII - GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS\nTo prevent any damage, do not use the rear axle as support for the lifting system.\nReplace all the brake pads on one axle at the same time. Never mix brake pads of different brands or qual- ity.\nLightly coat the threading on the support linkage with GREASE BR 2  + (see  Vehicle: Parts and consum- ables for the repair ) (04B, Consumables - Products).\nTo prevent the components of the rear axle from deteriorating (rubber bushes, brake hoses, etc.) do not remove the two shock absorbers at the same time. Proceed one side at a time.\nThe brake mechanism components are different on the left and right-hand sides, so it is essential not to con- fuse them. On the left-hand brake: the bolt thread has a right-hand thread. On the right-hand brake: the bolt has a left-hand thread.\nAdjust the brake pads by depressing the brake pedal repeatedly.\nTo avoid brake imbalance, both drums must be of the same diameter. Regrinding one drum necessi- tates regrinding of the opposite drum.\n2 - Rear brake drums, rear brake pads\nRemove all dust from the drums and the backplates us- ing brake cleaner.\nTo ensure the wheel speed sensor operates correctly, do not mark the sensor target on the drum's magnetic ring gear.\nREAR AXLE COMPONENTS Rear brake lining: Removal - Refitting 33A\nREAR BRAKE BOSCH: 9 INCHES\nReplace all the brake pads on one axle at the same time.

The risks caused by contamination are:\n- impossible to change gears,\n- damage to or destruction of the clutch system,\n- leaks on the hydraulic circuit.\n- Even the tiniest air bubble in the circuit can cause faulty operation (pedal failing to return properly, crunching sound when changing gear, etc.).\nAll the operations on the hydraulic clutch circuit sys- tem must be carried out under excellent cleanliness conditions. This ensures that no impurities enter the hydraulic circuit during the operation.\n- Incorrect bleeding can lead to incorrect detec- tion of faults and unnecessary part replace- ments.\nThe cleanliness principles apply to all components of the hydraulic clutch circuit.\nConsumables required for the repair:\nItems causing contamination are:\n- metal or plastic swarf,\na  Bleed the clutch circuit using approved (see  Vehi- cle: Parts and consumables for the repair ) brake fluid (04B, consumables - products).\nII - PREPARATION OPERATION\na  Position the vehicle on a two-post lift (see  Vehicle: Towing and lifting ) (02A, Lifting equipment).\na  Remove the engine undertray.\n• dust and particles in the air,\na  Use lint-free cleaning cloths (see  Products recom- mended for the repair ) (04B, Consumables - Prod- ucts).\nEach cloth must only be used once.\nMECHANICAL COMPONENT CONTROLS Clutch circuit: Bleed\nBleed screw with a clip.\nThere are several versions of bleed screw:\nScrew type bleed screw.\na  To open the bleed screw, press and hold the clip ( 4 ) while pulling by one notch.\na  To open the bleed screw, hold the plastic union ( 1 ) using a ring spanner and undo the bleed screw ( 2 ) .\nBleed screw with a clip.\nHalf-turn bleed screw.\na  To open the bleed screw, lift the clip ( 5 ) while pulling by one notch.\na  To open the bleed screw, fully turn the bleed screw ( 3 ) by hand.\nMECHANICAL COMPONENT CONTROLS Clutch circuit: Bleed\nBleed screw with two clips.\na  Connect the  brake circuit bleeding device  (after having received Renault approval) to the master cyl- inder reservoir (see the instructions for the equip- ment).\na  Remove the bleed plug from the clutch slave cylin- der.\na  Connect a transparent pipe to the bleed hole running to an empty container placed under the bleed hole.\na  Open the bleed screw.\na  Open the circuit between the bleeding device and the brake fluid reservoir.\na  Let the brake fluid run until all air bubbles have been released.\na  Stop the bleeding device to dump the pressure in the clutch circuit.\na  Close the bleed screw.\na  Remove the transparent pipe from the bleed hole.\na  Refit the bleed plug.\na  To open the bleed screw, lower the clip ( 6 ) and lift the clip ( 7 ) while pulling by one notch.\na  Top up the brake fluid level in the master cylinder reservoir after disconnecting the bleed device.\na  Disengage and engage the clutch quickly around twenty times.\nIII - BLEED PROCEDURE IF NO PARTS OF THE  HYDRAULIC CIRCUIT ARE REMOVED\na  Check that the clutch system is operating correctly.\n1 - Bleed using the ARC50.\na  Repeat the bleed operation if necessary.\na  Keep the clutch pedal in the upper position using a strap attached to the steering wheel to ensure conti- nuity of the hydraulic circuit during the bleed opera- tion.\na  Check the adjustment of the switch.

If there is a leak here, replace the seal ( A ) .\nIf the brake servo is not operational, the braking sys- tem will operate but the force required at the pedal to obtain the equivalent deceleration as for assisted braking is considerably higher.\nThe brake servo seals must be checked when fitted on the vehicle and when the hydraulic circuit is oper- ational.\na  Connect thebetween the brake servo and the vacu- um source (inlet manifold) with a « T » union and the shortest possible pipe.\na  Let the engine idle for approximately 10 minutes.\na  Press the pipe between the « T » union and the vac- uum source using the  (Ms. 583)  ( 1 ) .\nIf the vacuum drops by more than  33 mbar  in  15 se- conds , there is a leak either:\n- at the non-return valve (replace it),\n- at the pushrod diaphragm (if this is the case, you should replace the brake servo).\nANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM ABS: List and location of components 38C\n( 1 )  Hydraulic unit\n( 2 )  Steering wheel angle sensor\n( 3 )  ABS warning light on the instru- ment panel\n( 4 )  Brake lights switch\nANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM ABS: List and location of components 38C\n( 7 )  Lateral acceleration and yaw speed sensor\n( 8 )  ESP deactivation switch\n( 6 )  Diagnostic socket\n( 9 )  Brake disc with instrumented bearing\n( 10 )  Wheel speed sensor\nANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM ABS: List and location of components 38C\n( 11 )  Master cylinder\nANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM ABS: Precautions for the repair 38C\nSwitch off the vehicle ignition so as not to activate the hydraulic unit solenoid valves when bleeding the brake circuit.\n3 - Wheel speed sensor\n- If a lift must be used for an operation, respect the safety instructions (see  Vehicle: Towing and lifting ) (02A, Lifting equipment).\nTo ensure that the wheel speed sensor works prop- erly, do not mark the sensor target on the bearing.\n- Protect any bodywork components which could be damaged by brake fluid with covers.\n- to ensure there is no risk of sparks, do not place any metallic objects on the battery.\nIn order to prevent irreversible damage to the front  hub bearing:\n- Brake fluid is highly corrosive. Carefully clean any brake fluid spilt on parts of the vehicle.\n- Do not loosen or tighten the driveshaft nut when the wheels are on the ground.\n- Do not place the vehicle with its wheels on the ground when the driveshaft has been loosened or removed.\n- Clean around the braking system with  BRAKE CLEANER   (see  Vehicle: Parts and consumables for the repair ) (04B, Consumables - Products).\n- If a component is being replaced by a new one, do not remove the new component from its packaging until its is ready to be fitted onto the vehicle.\nTo avoid breaking the connection between the brake servo pushrod and the brake pedal, check that the safety clevis pin is locked onto the brake servo pushrod by tilting it from the top downwards.\nPrepare for the ﬂow of ﬂuid, and protect the sur- rounding components.\nIII - GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS\n- During an operation which requires the braking circuit to be opened, position a  pedal press  on the brake pedal to limit the outflow of brake fluid.\n- After any operation on the ABS, it is essential to con- firm the repair with a road test and a check using the Diagnostic tool .\n1 -

Topping up the electrolyte is therefore prohibited.\nIf it comes into contact with the skin or eyes, seek medical attention.\nBefore disconnecting the battery:\n2 - DANGER: RISK OF EXPLOSION LINKED TO  CHARGING AND TO INCORRECT TIGHTENING OF  THE TERMINALS.\n- wait for the motor-driven fan assembly to stop,\n- wait for the computer to ﬁnish saving ( 1 minute ).\nTo prevent damaging the battery or even causing it to explode, do not place any heat sources or create any sparks near a charging battery.\nSome vehicles are only ﬁtted with « TB » (low height) batteries. To avoid damaging the bonnet, only reﬁt a battery which is identical to the battery originally ﬁtted.\nIncorrect tightening could cause heating of con- tacts, starting or charging faults, sparking, or could cause the battery to explode.\nWhen a battery is charging, oxygen and hydrogen are produced. The mixture of these two gases is explosive.\nThe smallest of sparks or heat sources can cause an explosion. The explosion is so strong that the battery can shatter and spray the acid into the surrounding at- mosphere.\nPeople nearby are at risk (exploded fragments, acid splashes). Acid splashes are dangerous. They also damage clothing.\nSafeguarding against the danger of explosion, which can be caused by handling a battery carelessly, must be taken very seriously.\nBATTERY Battery: Removal - Refitting 80A\nII - OPERATION FOR REMOVAL OF PART  CONCERNED\nbattery bracket bolt 12 Nm\nbolt on the positive bat- tery terminal 6 N.m\nnegative battery termi- nal nut 6 N.m\nConsult the safety and cleanliness advice and oper- ation recommendations before carrying out any repair (see  80A ,  Battery ,  Battery: Precautions for the repair , page  80A-1 ) .\nI - REMOVAL PREPARATION OPERATION\na  Switch off the ignition.\na  Undo the negative battery terminal nut ( 1 ) .\nBefore disconnecting the battery:\n- wait for the motor-driven fan assembly to stop,\nMark the position of the negative battery termi- nal.\n- wait for the computer to ﬁnish saving ( 1 minute ).\na  Remove the negative battery terminal.\nThe visual indicator cannot be considered reli- able in After-Sales;

Depending on the type of vehicle equipment, proceed as follows:\nFor vehicles with radio frequency remote control/key, switch on the ignition with the key.\nTo cut off the + after ignition feed, proceed as follows:\nFor vehicles with radio frequency remote control/key, switch off the ignition with the key.\n13B-2 V1 MR-453-X79-13B000$010.mif\nDCM 1.2 injection Program No.: 4C Vdiag No.: 08\nFault finding – Introduction 13B\nFaults are declared as either present or stored (depending on whether they appeared in a certain context and have  disappeared since, or whether they remain present but have not been diagnosed within the current context).\nThe status of the fault,  present  or  stored , should be taken into consideration when the  diagnostic tool  is used after  the  + after ignition feed  has been activated (without any of the system components being activated).\nFor a  present fault , apply the procedure described in the  Interpretation of faults  section.\nFor a  stored fault , note the faults displayed and apply the  Notes  section.\nIf the fault is  confirmed  when the instructions in the Notes section are applied, the fault is present. Deal with the  fault.\nIf the fault is  not confirmed , check: – the electrical lines which correspond to the fault, – the connectors on these lines (corrosion, bent pins, etc.), – the resistance of the faulty component, – the condition of the wires (melted or cut insulation, wear).\nThe aim of the conformity check is to check data that do not produce a fault display on the  diagnostic tool  when  they are inconsistent. Therefore, this phase makes it possible to:  – run fault finding on faults that do not have a fault display, and which may correspond to a customer complaint, – check that the system is operating correctly and that there is no risk of a fault recurring after repair.\nThis section gives the fault finding procedures for the statuses and the parameters and the conditions for checking  them.\nIf a status is not behaving normally or a parameter is outside permitted tolerance values, you should consult the  corresponding fault finding page.\nCustomer complaints - Fault finding chart\nIf the test with the  diagnostic tool  is OK but the customer complaint is still present, the fault should be dealt with by  customer complaints .\nA synopsis of the general procedure to follow is provided on the following page in the form of a flow chart.\n13B-3 V1 MR-453-X79-13B000$010.mif\nDCM 1.2 injection Program No.: 4C Vdiag No.: 08\nFault finding – Introduction 13B\n4.

FAULT FINDING PROCEDURE (continued)\nFault finding problems Disconnecting the connectors and/or manipulating the wiring may temporarily clear the cause of a fault. Electrical measurements of voltage, resistance and insulation are generally correct, especially if the fault is not  present when the analysis is made (stored fault).\nVisual inspection Look for damage under the bonnet and in the passenger compartment. Carefully check the fuses, insulators and wiring harness routing. Look for signs of oxidation.\nTactile inspection When handling the wiring, use the  diagnostic tool  to detect any change in fault statuses from \"stored\" to \"present\". Make sure that the connectors are firmly secured. Apply light pressure to the connectors. Twist the wiring harness. If there is a change in status, try to locate the source of the fault.\nInspection of each component Disconnect the connectors and check the appearance of the clips and tabs, as well as the crimping (no crimping on  the insulating section). Make sure that the clips and tabs are properly locked in the sockets. Check that the clips or tabs have not been bent back during connection. Check the clip contact pressure using an appropriate model of tab.\nResistance check Check the continuity of the complete lines, then section by section. Look for a short circuit to earth, to  + 12 V  or with another wire.\nIf a fault is detected, repair or replace the wiring harness.\n13B-5 V1 MR-453-X79-13B000$010.mif\nDCM 1.2 injection Program No.: 4C Vdiag No.: 08\nFault finding – Introduction 13B\nIMPORTANT All faults involving a complex system call for thorough diagnostics with the appropriate tools. The  FAULT FINDING LOG, which should be completed during the fault finding procedure, ensures a  record is kept of the procedure carried out. It is an essential document when consulting the  manufacturer.\nIT IS THEREFORE MANDATORY TO FILL OUT A FAULT FINDING LOG EVERY TIME THE TECHLINE OR THE WARRANTY RETURN SERVICE ASKS FOR IT.\nYou will always be asked for this log: – when requesting technical assistance from the Techline, – when requesting approval before replacing parts for which approval is compulsory, – to be enclosed when returning monitored parts on request. The log is needed for warranty reimbursement, and  enables better analysis of the parts which have been removed.\n6. SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS\nSafety rules must be observed during any work on a component to prevent any material damage or personal injury: – make sure that the battery is properly charged to avoid damaging the computers with a low charge, – use the appropriate tools.\n13B-6 V1 MR-453-X79-13B000$010.mif\nDCM 1.2 injection Program No.: 4C Vdiag No.: 08\nFault finding – Cleanliness guidelines\nI - RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CONTAMINATION\nThe high pressure direct injection system is highly sensitive to contamination. The risks caused by the introduction  of contamination are: – damage to or destruction of the high pressure injection system, – a component seizing up, – a component losing its sealing.\nAll After-Sales operations must be performed under very clean conditions. This means that no impurities  (particles a few microns in size) should have penetrated the system during dismantling.\nThe cleanliness guidelines must be applied from the filter through to the injectors.\nWhat are the sources of contamination? – metal or plastic chips, – paint, – fibres: – from cardboard, – from brushes, – from paper, – from clothing, – from cloths, – foreign bodies such as hair, – the ambient atmosphere, – etc.\nIMPORTANT   Cleaning the engine using a high pressure washer is prohibited because of the risk of damaging connections. In  addition, moisture may collect in the connectors and create faults in the electrical connections.\n13B-7 V1 MR-453-X79-13B000$020.mif\nDCM 1.2 injection Program No.: 4C Vdiag No.: 08\nFault finding – Cleanliness guidelines 13B\nII - INSTRUCTIONS TO BE FOLLOWED BEFORE CARRYING OUT ANY WORK\nIMPORTANT Before carrying out any work on the high pressure injection system, protect: – the accessories belts, – the electrical accessories, (starter, alternator, electric power-assisted steering pump), – the flywheel surface, to prevent any diesel from running onto the clutch friction plate. – timing chain\nEnsure that you have plugs for the unions to be opened (set of plugs available from the Parts Department). Plugs are  to be used only once. They must be discarded after use (once used they are soiled and cleaning is not sufficient to  make them reusable). Unused plugs must be thrown away.\nEnsure that you have hermetically resealable plastic bags for storing removed parts. Parts stored in this way will be  less susceptible to the risk of contamination. The bags are to be used once only, and discarded after use.\nUse lint-free cleaning cloths (cloth part reference  77 11 211 707 ). The use of ordinary cloth or paper is not permitted.  They are not lint-free and could contaminate the fuel circuit. A lint-free cloth should only be used once.\nUse fresh cleaning agent for each operation (used cleaning agent is contaminated). Pour it into a clean receptacle.\nFor each operation, use a clean brush in good condition (the brush must not shed its bristles).\nUse a brush and cleaning agent to clean the unions to be opened.\nBlow compressed air over the cleaned parts (tools, workbench, the parts, unions and injection system zones). Check  that no bristles are left.\nWash your hands before and during the operation if necessary.\nWhen wearing leather protective gloves cover them with latex gloves to prevent contamination.\n13B-8 V1 MR-453-X79-13B000$020.mif\nDCM 1.2 injection Program No.: 4C Vdiag No.: 08\nFault finding – Cleanliness guidelines 13B\nIII - INSTRUCTIONS TO BE FOLLOWED DURING THE OPERATION\nAs soon as the circuit is open, all openings must be plugged to prevent impurities from entering the system.  The plugs to be used are available from the Parts Department. The plugs must not be reused under any  circumstances.\nSeal the pouch shut, even if it has to be opened shortly afterwards. The ambient atmosphere carries contamination.\nAll components removed from the injection system must be stored in a hermetically-sealed plastic bag once  the plugs have been inserted.\nUsing a brush, cleaning agent, air gun, brush or normal cloth is strictly prohibited once the circuit has been opened.  These items could allow contamination to enter the system.\nA new component replacing an old one must not be removed from its packaging until it is to be fitted to the vehicle.\n13B-9 V1 MR-453-X79-13B000$020.mif\nDCM 1.2 injection Program No.: 4C Vdiag No.: 08\nFault finding – System operation\nThe  DCM1.2  injection system used on the  K9K  engine is an electronically managed high pressure injection system.  The fuel is compressed by a high pressure pump then stored in a rail that feeds the injectors. Injection takes place  when a current pulse is applied to the injector holders.\nThe injection flow is proportional to the rail pressure and to the applied pulse length, and the start of injection is  synchronised with the start of the pulse.\nThe system includes two subsystems, which have different fuel pressure levels: – the low pressure circuit contains the tank, the diesel fuel filter, the transfer pump and the injector holder return pipes, – the high pressure circuit contains the high pressure pump, the rail, the injector holders and the high pressure tubes.\nThe injection system contains a number of control sensors and actuators that enable the entire system to be  controlled and monitored.\nFunction: Fuel supply management (timing, flow and pressure).\nQuantity of fuel injected and injection timing setting The injection checking parameters are the quantities to be injected and their respective timing. These are calculated by the computer using signals from the following sensors: – Engine speed (crankshaft + cam lobe for synchronisation). – Accelerator pedal. – Turbocharging pressure and air temperature (Turbocharger pressure). – Coolant temperature. – Air temperature. – Air load (Flow and Pressure). – Rail pressure.\nThe quantities to be injected and their respective timing are converted into: – a reference tooth, – the time between this tooth and the start of activation, – the time for which the supply to the injector holder is on.\nEach injector holder is controlled by an electrical current which is sent according to previously calculated data. The  system makes one or two injections (one pilot injection, one main injection). The general principle is to calculate an overall injected flow, which is then divided into the main injection flow, and a  pilot injection flow to promote proper combustion and help reduce pollutant emissions.\n13B-10 V1 MR-453-X79-13B000$030.mif\nDCM 1.2 injection Program No.: 4C Vdiag No.: 08\nFault finding – System operation 13B\nAn accelerometer is used to monitor some of the fuel injection deviation. This has several roles: – Protecting the engine by detecting injection leaks (disabled on the basic version). – Checking the pilot quantity by measuring deviation and variation.\nThe quantity of fuel injected and the exact moment the mixture ignites can be readjusted by changing both the  injection duration and advance.\nRail pressure check The quality of combustion is influenced by the size of the atomised droplets in the cylinder.\nIn the combustion chamber, smaller fuel droplets will have time to burn fully, and will not produce smoke or unburned  particles. To meet the pollution requirements, the droplet size, and therefore the size of the injection holes must be  reduced.\nWith smaller holes, less fuel will be able to be introduced at a given pressure, which limits the power. To offset this  disadvantage, the quantity of fuel injected must be increased, which means increased pressure (and more holes in  the injector nozzles).  For the  DCM 1.2  injection system, the pressure reaches  1400 bar - 1600 bar  in the rail and must be constantly  regulated. The measuring circuit comprises an active pressure sensor on the rail connected to an analogue port on  the computer.\nThe high pressure pump is supplied at low pressure ( 5 bar ) by a built-in transfer pump. It supplies the rail, the  pressure of which is controlled by the fuel flow actuator ( IMV ) for filling, and by the injector valves for discharging.  This compensates for pressure drops. The fuel flow actuator enables the high pressure pump to only supply the  quantity of diesel fuel required to maintain the rail pressure. This mechanism minimises the heat generated and  improves engine output.\nIn order to discharge the rail using the injector valves, the valves are actuated by short electrical pulses which are: – short enough in amplitude not to open the injector (and pass through the return circuit from the injectors), – long enough in time to open the valves and discharge the rail.\nThe fuel surplus is sent back to the fuel filter or the tank, according to its flow. If there is no fuel flow actuator control,  the rail pressure is limited by a discharge valve fitted on the pump.\nNew pump chamber filling procedure (pump boosting) The pump lubrication goes through a booster cycle during which the pump is filled and pressurised before  \"transferring\" the diesel fuel to the rail.\nThis lubrication goes through programming called  \"new pump chamber filling\" , which prohibits starting for  approximately  10 seconds , which is the time required to fill the pump and to start if the key is released before the  end of this \"first starting\" phase. \"Power latch\" is not necessary before attempting to start the vehicle again.\nThis procedure runs when a  computer is replaced  if the parameters relating to the rail pressure have not been  copied into the new computer, or when an injection computer is reprogrammed.\n13B-11 V1 MR-453-X79-13B000$030.mif\nDCM 1.2 injection Program No.: 4C Vdiag No.: 08\nFault finding – System operation 13B\nIdling speed regulation The computer handles the calculation of idling speed. This has to take account of the instantaneous power level to  be supplied, according to the status of the following components: – engine coolant temperature, – gear ratio engaged, – battery charge, – electrical consumers (Additional heating, Air conditioning, Fan Unit, electric windows, etc.) active or inactive, – system faults detected.\nIndividual injector correction (C2I) The  DCM 1.2  system injectors must be calibrated with corrective values to adjust their flow precisely. Each injector  is calibrated for different pressures on a test bench, and its specifications are shown on a label attached to the body  of the injector holders. These individual correction values are entered in the computer EEPROM, which can then  actuate the injectors by taking into account their manufacturing dispersion.\nMeasuring the angular position (Cylinder reference sensor) The angular position is measured using a magneto-inductive sensor triggered by machined teeth on the crankshaft  flywheel. This flywheel has sixty teeth separated by six degrees minus two missing teeth, that form a notch.\nA second sensor (Hall effect) triggered by a machined tooth on the high pressure pump drive pulley (synchronised  with the camshaft), that rotates at half the engine speed, supplies an injection cycle running signal. When comparing  the signals from these two sensors, the APS (Angular Position Subsystem) module of the computer is capable of  providing details of the synchronisation components to the system:  – the angular position of the flywheel – the engine speed, the number of the active injector  – the stage of the injection cycle.  This module also supplies the system with the rotation speed signal.\nFlow capacity function (VLC) Because of the combination of several parameters such as the diesel fuel temperature, part wear, clogging of the  diesel filter etc., the system limit may be reached during its service life. If this happens, the rail pressure cannot be  maintained because the pump lacks the necessary capacity. If the pump lacks the necessary capacity, this  programming will therefore reduce the requested flow to a value that will enable the pressure monitoring system to  control the pressure again. The customer may have noticed a loss of vehicle performance when this program is activated (confirmed by the  Flow capacity function  status).  This is part of normal operation.\n13B-12 V1 MR-453-X79-13B000$030.mif\nDCM 1.2 injection Program No.: 4C Vdiag No.: 08\nFault finding – System operation 13B\nFunction: Air flow management\nEGR valve control The EGR system (Exhaust gas recirculation) comprises a proportional EGR valve, with a built-in valve position  feedback potentiometer. The EGR valve position is controlled by the potentiometer in a closed loop and/or by  changes in the estimated air flow.\nCalculating the air flow The  K9K 790 and 794  engines are not fitted with an air flowmeter. Instead, the amount of fresh inlet air is evaluated  based on the values supplied by the surrounding systems.\nThe (theoretical) air load is calculated using a model with various calculation parameters, which are: – the inlet air temperature measured by a sensor located after the turbocharger and/or after the exchanger (if fitted), – the turbocharging pressure, – the atmospheric pressure (external air), – the EGR valve position, – the fuel flow, – the engine speed.\nThe atmospheric pressure sensor is optional. If fitted, it sends back a signal relating to the atmospheric pressure to  an analogue port on the micro-controller. If not, atmospheric pressure is recovered based on the turbocharger  pressure and the engine field.\nFor  K9K 792 and 796  engines, the flow of fresh air entering the engine is given by a hot wire ratiometric sensor. This  flowmeter is used to manage the amount of exhaust gas to be recirculated to ensure optimum recirculation rates. A  fresh air temperature sensor is integrated into the flowmeter. Air flow measurement allows closed-loop control via  the EGR valve.\nK9K 796 engine: The turbocharging system is made up of a solenoid valve which is used to control the wastegate to adjust the  absolute pressure of the inlet circuit.\nK9K 790, 792, and 794 engines: The turbocharger system is controlled by the inlet pressure and does not need to be controlled by the computer.\nPre-postheating control Pre/postheating control consists of controlling the heater plugs and preheating warning light on the instrument panel.  The heater plugs are activated by a preheating unit (controlled by the injection computer) and power is supplied by  the battery. After the ignition is switched on a preheating delay is activated. The warning light comes on for a time  dependent on the battery voltage, atmospheric pressure and coolant temperature. If the temperature is below a  certain threshold, a postheating function can be used to improve the combustion stability, and consequently engine  operation (reducing unburnt particles and pollutant emissions).\n13B-13 V1 MR-453-X79-13B000$030.mif\nDCM 1.2 injection Program No.: 4C Vdiag No.: 08\nFault finding – System operation 13B\nAir conditioning management assistance For models with air conditioning, the  DCM 1.2  system allows deactivation of the air conditioning under certain  operating conditions: – when requested by the driver, – when starting the engine, – if the engine overheats (in order to reduce the power the engine has to supply), – when the engine speed is kept at a very high level (to protect the compressor), – during transition phases (e.g. high acceleration demand for overtaking, anti-stalling and moving off). These  conditions are only taken into account if they do not occur repeatedly, so as to prevent system instabilities (erratic  deactivation), – when certain faults appear.\nCold loop air conditioning management The air conditioning is the cold loop type and it is managed by the injection computer, which must: – manage the cooling request according to passenger compartment commands and the refrigerant pressure value, – calculate the power absorbed by the compressor (from the refrigerant fluid pressure). – determining the  fan unit  commands according to the vehicle speed and the refrigerant fluid pressure.\nThe driver requests the air conditioning to be switched on by means of the ventilation selector coupled to a switch.  This cooling request is authorised or refused according to the refrigerant pressure measured. If this pressure is  outside the operating limits, the cold loop program is not activated.\nNote: Fan unit  control requests are made from the injection computer. These requests depend on the air conditioning, but also on the engine coolant temperature and vehicle speed.\nThermal regulation of the passenger compartment heating circuit Engines with direct injection systems are characterised by fuel being injected directly into the combustion chamber.  This leads to heat being lost through the upper part of the engine and consequently, the cylinder head cooling circuit  is smaller in size.\nThe effect of this is that the temperature of the coolant which flows through this circuit rises more slowly. This coolant  is also used by the passenger compartment heating system. In very cold conditions, it is therefore difficult to achieve  a comfortable passenger compartment temperature quickly.\nTo limit the time taken to warm up the system, air heating resistors, called passenger compartment heating resistors  (RCH), are fitted into the passenger compartment heating circuit. The  DCM1.2  injection computer determines the  need to control, and physically controls the passenger compartment heating resistors. The injection computer  determines the power control limitation of the passenger compartment heating resistors based on the alternator  charge on one hand, and the inhibition of passenger compartment heating resistors based on engine speed, load  and vehicle speed, on the other.\n13B-14 V1 MR-453-X79-13B000$030.mif\nDCM 1.2 injection Program No.: 4C Vdiag No.: 08\nFault finding – System operation 13B\nInstrument panel display The computer manages the data display on the instrument panel relating to engine operation. There are six functions concerned:  – the  On board diagnostics   MIL  (Malfunction Indicator Lamp), – pre-postheating, – coolant temperature, –  Level 1  (non-critical fault) and  Level 2  (emergency stop) engine faults. – detection of water in the fuel (depending on instrument panel). These six functions are represented using four indicator lights.\nPre-postheating and electronic fault (level 1) indicator light This warning light is used as an operation indicator light for the heater plugs and as a system fault warning light. – Continuously lit during  + after ignition feed : indicates preheating of the plugs. – Flashing after preheating and an automatic  3-second  stop, indicates a  Level 1  fault (indicates a reduced level of  operation and a limited safety level. The user must carry out repairs as soon as possible).\nEngine coolant temperature warning light (level 2) This indicator light is used both as an in-operation indicator light and as a system fault warning light. It illuminates for  3 seconds  when the power comes on (automatic test procedure). Continuously lit during  + after ignition feed : indicates engine overheating or a  level 2  fault.\nOBD warning light This warning light is used to alert the driver of any injection faults causing excessive pollution, or if the  OBD  system  is deactivated. The injection computer requests the illumination of the  OBD  warning light for a present fault only after three  successive driving cycles. The  3 second  visual inspection when the ignition is switched on (automatic test procedure managed by the  instrument panel) is carried out by the injection computer.\n13B-15 V1 MR-453-X79-13B000$030.mif\nDCM 1.2 injection Program No.: 4C Vdiag No.: 08\nFault finding – System operation 13B\nFaults that activate the OBD warning light\nTool fault Diagnostic tool name Specification\nDF016 EGR control circuit CO - CO. 0 CC.1 - 1.DEF\nDF026 Cylinder 1 injector circuit control CO - CC\nDF027 Cylinder 2 injector circuit control CO - CC\nDF028 Cylinder 3 injector circuit control CO - CC\nDF029 Cylinder 4 injector circuit control CO - CC\nDF107 Computer memory 2.DEF\nDF114 EGR solenoid valve circuit 4.DEF\nDF209 EGR valve position sensor circuit CC.1-CO.0\nWater present in fuel warning light  (depending on the instrument panel) This warning light is used to warn the driver about the presence of water in the fuel filter, which leads to engine  damage.

FAULT FINDING PROCEDURE (continued)\nFault finding problems Disconnecting the connectors and/or manipulating the wiring may temporarily remove the cause of a fault. Electrical measurements of voltage, resistance and insulation are generally correct, especially if the fault is not  present when the analysis is made (stored fault).\nVisual inspection Look for damage under the bonnet and in the passenger compartment. Carefully check the fuses, insulators and wiring harness routing. Look for signs of oxidation.\nPhysical inspection While manipulating the wiring, use the diagnostic tool to note any change in fault status from stored to present. Make sure that the connectors are properly locked. Apply light pressure to the connectors. Twist the wiring harness. If there is a change in status, try to locate the source of the fault.\nInspection of each component Disconnect the connectors and check the appearance of the clips and tabs, as well as the crimping (no crimping  on the insulating section). Make sure that the clips and tabs are properly locked in the sockets. Check that no clips or tabs have been dislodged during connection. Check the clip contact pressure using an appropriate model of tab.\nResistance check Check the continuity of entire lines, then section by section. Look for a short circuit to earth, to  + 12 V  or with another wire.\nIf a fault is detected, repair or replace the wiring harness.\n17B - 5 V1 MR-453-X79-17B000$010.mif\nEMS 3130 injection Program No.: EB Vdiag No.: 04\nFault finding – Introduction 17B\nIMPORTANT Any fault on a complex system requires thorough fault finding with the appropriate tools.  The FAULT FINDING LOG, which should be completed during the fault finding procedure,  ensures a record is kept of the procedure carried out. It is an essential document when  consulting the manufacturer.\nIT IS THEREFORE MANDATORY TO FILL OUT A FAULT FINDING LOG WHENEVER THE TECHLINE OR THE WARRANTY RETURNS DEPARTMENT REQUESTS IT.\nYou will always be asked for this log: • when requesting technical assistance from Techline, • for approval requests when replacing parts for which approval is mandatory, • to be attached to monitored parts for which reimbursement is requested. The log is needed for warranty  reimbursement, and enables better analysis of the parts removed.\n17B - 6 V1 MR-453-X79-17B000$010.mif\nEMS 3130 injection Program No.: EB Vdiag No.: 04\nFault finding – Introduction 17B\n6. INSTRUCTIONS TO BE FOLLOWED FOR ANY WORK CARRIED OUT ON THE INJECTION SYSTEM\nInstructions to be followed before opening of the fuel circuit\nUse fresh cleaning agent for each operation (used cleaning agent is contaminated). Pour it into an uncontaminated  container. For each operation, use a clean brush in good condition (the brush must not shed its bristles). Use a brush and cleaning agent to clean the unions to be opened. Blast compressed air over the cleaned parts (tools, workbench, and the parts, unions and injection system area).  Check that no bristles remain. Wash your hands before and during the operation if necessary. When wearing leather protective gloves cover them with latex gloves to prevent contamination.\nInstructions to be followed during the operation\nAs soon as the circuit is open, all openings must be plugged to prevent impurities from entering the system. The  plugs to be used are available from the Parts Department. The plugs must not be reused under any circumstances. Seal the pouch shut, even if it has to be opened shortly afterwards. Ambient air carries impurities. All components removed from the injection system must be stored in a hermetically sealed plastic bag once they  have been plugged. The use of a brush, cleaning agent, bellows, sponge or normal cloth is strictly forbidden once the circuit has been  opened. These items could allow contamination to enter the system. A new component replacing an old one must not be removed from its packaging until it is to be fitted to the vehicle.\n17B - 7 V1 MR-453-X79-17B000$010.mif\nEMS 3130 injection Program No.: EB Vdiag No.: 04\nFault finding – System operation\nSpecial notes for multipoint injection\n•  \"ESM3130\" 96-track  computer controlling the injection and the ignition.\n• Multipoint injection operating in sequential mode without a cylinder marking sensor or camshaft position sensor.

Observation of a drop  in torque detects combustion misfires.\nThis fault finding is performed practically continuously while the car is being driven. If it is not carried out, or if a fault  is detected, all other OBD fault finding will be inhibited.\nThis diagnostic strategy makes it possible to diagnose two types of fault: – destructive misfires that damage the catalytic converter, and cause the OBD warning light to begin flashing  immediately, – polluting misfires that result in the OBD pollution limit being exceeded, and cause the OBD warning light to  illuminate if they are detected during three consecutive journeys.\n17B - 19 V1 MR-453-X79-17B000$020.mif\nEMS 3130 injection Program No.: EB Vdiag No.: 04\nFault finding – System operation 17B\nDETECTION CONDITIONS Check that programming has been correctly carried out. The conditions prior to switching on the ignition and the  current conditions must also be satisfied.\nMake sure statuses: – ET061 Cylinder 1 recognition is PERFORMED and – ET422 Combustion misfire diag* included, is YES .\nDetection is carried out as soon as the coolant temperature is above  75˚C , and over three different engine working  speeds between  idle speed  and  4500 rpm .\nThe test can also be performed by keeping the engine at idle speed  for 11 minutes .\nIMPORTANT Do not switch off the ignition before the result is read on the diagnostic tool at the end of each test.  Switching off the ignition will lead to the results being misinterpreted.\nIf after the test, the diagnostic tool has recorded misfires, see the procedures for dealing with faults DF123  Polluting misfire and DF124 Destructive misfire.\nCONFIRMATION OF THE REPAIR –  ET061 Cylinder 1 recognition  is  PERFORMED –  ET422 Combustion misfire diag* included  is  YES . – No fault detected and  OBD warning light off .\nCatalytic converter fault finding The aim of catalytic converter fault finding is to detect a malfunction that causes hydrocarbon pollutant emissions to  exceed the OBD limit. The ability of the catalytic converter to store oxygen indicates its condition. As the catalytic converter ages, its ability  to store oxygen reduces along with its ability to treat pollutant gases.\n17B - 20 V1 MR-453-X79-17B000$020.mif\nEMS 3130 injection Program No.: EB Vdiag No.: 04\nFault finding – System operation 17B\nCONDITIONS FOR STARTING FAULT FINDING Fault finding of the catalytic converter can only take place after the engine has been running for the time detailed in  the following table, if all the conditions prior to switching on the ignition are satisfied and maintained: – no electrical faults, – cylinder 1 position recognition performed, – no combustion misfires detected, – no catalytic converter fault finding performed since the ignition was switched on, – programming done, – main loop and double loop active, – coolant temperature greater than  75ºC .\nEngine Speed,  mph (kph) Engine speed  (rpm)\nStabilisation  time (s) Time before  enabling (min)\nManifold  pressure  (mbar)\nK4M 63/130 1856/3808 400/750 11 17\nFAULT DETECTION Fault finding is performed over a stabilised range in  5 th   gear  at  43 mph  ( 70 km/h ). When the conditions for starting  fault finding are satisfied, richness excitation peaks are applied, having the effect of sending bursts of oxygen into  the catalytic converter. If the catalytic converter is in good condition it absorbs the oxygen and the downstream  oxygen sensor value will remain at its average value. If it is worn, it rejects the oxygen and the oxygen sensor will  start to vibrate. The voltage of the oxygen sensor fluctuates. If the fault is confirmed three consecutive times, the  OBD warning light illuminates.\nThe test cannot last longer than  52 seconds .\nIMPORTANT Do not switch off the ignition before the result is read on the diagnostic tool at the end of each test.  Switching off the ignition will lead to the results being misinterpreted.\nIf after the test, the diagnostic tool recorded an operating fault of the catalytic converter, see the procedure for  dealing with fault DF394 Catalytic converter operating fault.\nCONFIRMATION OF THE REPAIR –  ET345 Catalytic converter fault finding included  is  ACTIVE –  ET349 Catalytic converter fault finding performed  is  YES – No catalytic converter operating fault detected.\n17B - 21 V1 MR-453-X79-17B000$020.mif\nEMS 3130 injection Program No.: EB Vdiag No.: 04\nFault finding – System operation 17B\nOxygen sensor fault finding The purpose of oxygen sensor fault finding is to detect a fault which causes the hydrocarbon pollutant emissions to  exceed the OBD limit. It is performed by measuring and comparing oxygen sensor vibration periods.\nThere are two types of possible faults on the oxygen sensors: – mechanical damage to an electrical component (breakage, cut in wire) which leads to an electrical fault, – chemical damage to the component which causes the response time of the sensor to slow down, thus  increasing its switching period.\nWhen the required test conditions are met, the average of the sensor periods read is taken, subtracting the effects of  interference, then compared with an average period of the OBD limit.\nTEST CONDITIONS Fault finding of the oxygen sensor can only take place after the engine has been running for a while and under  specific operating conditions, detailed in the table below, and if all the conditions prior to the ignition being switched  on are met and maintained: – no electrical faults detected, – programming and cylinder recognition done, – no oxygen sensor fault finding performed since the ignition was switched on, – no combustion misfires detected, – coolant temperature greater than  75ºC .\nEngine Speed,  mph (kph) Engine speed  (rpm)\nStabilisation  time (s) Time before  enabling (min)\nManifold  pressure  (mbar)\nK4M 63/130 1856/3808 380/850 8 14\n17B - 22 V1 MR-453-X79-17B000$020.mif\nEMS 3130 injection Program No.: EB Vdiag No.: 04\nFault finding – System operation 17B\nFAULT DETECTION Fault finding is performed while the vehicle is being driven in one gear, travelling at a steady speed and for the  minimum period of time specified in the following table:\nEngine Gear Speed, mph (kph) Maximum period (s)\nFor this test, the computer inhibits fuel vapour absorber bleeding.

Before any starting request, the injection computer is protected. When a starting request is made, the injection computer and the Passenger Compartment Control Unit (UCH)  exchange authentication data via the multiplex network. This determines whether the engine start is authorised or  denied.\nAfter more than five consecutive failed authentication attempts, the injection computer goes into protection (anti- scanning) mode and no longer tries to authenticate the UCH computer. It only leaves this mode when the following  sequence of operations is carried out: – the ignition is left on for at least  20 seconds ,  – the message is switched off, – the end of the injection computer self-feed is adhered to (the length of time varies depending on engine  temperature).\nAfter this, one and only one authentication attempt is allowed. If this fails again, repeat the sequence of operations  described above. If the injection computer still fails to unlock, contact the Techline.\nImpact detected If an impact has been  stored  by the injection computer, turn off the ignition for  10 seconds , then switch it back on to  start the engine. Clear the faults using the control  RZ001 Fault memory .\nWARNING Disconnect the injection system computer when carrying out any welding work on the vehicle.",

    "page_content": "Engine speed management is based on the following programs:\n– Engine speed management when starting – Engine speed management according to engine vibrations – Idle speed management – Engine speed restriction – Engine speed management according to its status\nEngine speed management when starting\nThis programming is used: – To set the injection timing when starting, using the TDC (Top Dead Centre) sensor – To calculate the amount of fuel to be injected into the cylinders to avoid flooding the engine.\nPreventive correction of engine speed linked to vibrations\nProgramming that enables user comfort to be optimised during acceleration or deceleration which causes a harsh  change in engine torque and therefore vibration in the driveshaft. Torque management is important during these  situations.\nCurative correction of engine speed linked to vibrations\nThis programming is used to absorb the oscillations in engine speed caused by vibration in the driveshaft.\n17B-9 V1 MR-453-X79-17B050$050.mif\nV42 Injection Program No.: 2A Vdiag No.: 04, 06\nFault finding – Features 17B\nIdle speed management\nThis programming is used to calculate the adapted idle speed according to the conditions of use (cold engine,  air conditioning requests, electrical consumer use etc.).\nThis is managed by a motorised throttle valve which is controlled by the injection computer. The injection computer also performs the following tasks using the motorised throttle:  – management of valve oscillations which can produce undesirable torque, – management of valve movement subject to mechanical faults when the valve reaches its mechanical boundaries, – management of acoustic faults by limiting throttle opening at a certain engine speed and when stopping the engine.\nThe torque structure is the system for managing engine torque. It is necessary for some functions such as the  electronic stability program (ESP), automatic transmission (BVA) or sequential gearbox (BVR).\nEach computer (ESP, sequential gearbox, automatic transmission) sends a request for torque via the multiplex  network to the injection computer. This arbitrates between the various torque requests and the driver's request  (made via the accelerator pedal or the cruise control/speed limiter).\nThe result of this arbitration gives the torque setpoint. The computer then calculates the throttle position setpoint, the  ignition advance  and the wastegate setpoint  (if a turbocharged engine) in order to provide the necessary torque.\nManagement of ignition advance enables the combustion quality to be managed and therefore engine operation  to be optimised. For a positive advance, the ignition point will be before TDC*, however the advance can have  a negative value. TDC*: Top Dead Centre.\nFuel supply management\nThe fuel pump ensures the supply of fuel. It is activated for one second each time the + after ignition feed is switched  on. It ensures the correct level of pressure in the circuit and thereby achieves correct engine starting, particularly if  the vehicle has not been used for a long time. When the engine is running, the pump relay is controlled and therefore  the pump is always active. The petrol vapour absorber enables petrol vapour to be collected in order to limit its release into the atmosphere.\nRichness is managed using the upstream and downstream oxygen sensors located on the exhaust. For the sensors  to be operational quickly, they need to be heated by the exhaust gas and by a resistor internal to the sensor. These  sensors reflect the efficiency of combustion and, using information sent to the computer, they enable the quantity of  fuel injected to be managed in order to meet the emission control standards and to ensure optimum engine  operation.\n17B-10 V1 MR-453-X79-17B050$050.mif\nV42 Injection Program No.: 2A Vdiag No.: 04, 06\nFault finding – Features 17B\nEngine temperature management\nThe engine is cooled by a 2-speed fan assembly. To cool the engine, the first speed of the GMV* is activated if the coolant temperature exceeds  99˚C , then the  second speed is activated if the temperature exceeds  102˚C . A \"very high temperature\" warning light illuminates on  the instrument panel if the temperature exceeds  108˚C .

For a  stored fault , note the faults displayed and apply the Notes section.\nIf the fault is  confirmed  when the instructions are applied, the fault is present. Deal with the fault. If the fault is  not confirmed , check: – the electrical connections that correspond to the fault, – the connectors for this connection, – the resistance of the faulty component, – the condition of the wires. Refer to paragraphs 4.1 Checking wiring and 4.2 Checking connectors\nThe aim of the conformity check is to check data that does not produce a fault on the  diagnostic tool  when the data  is inconsistent. Therefore, this stage is used to:  – carry out fault finding on faults that do not have a fault display, and which may correspond to a customer complaint, – check that the system is operating correctly and that there is no risk of a fault recurring after repairs.\nThis section gives the fault finding procedures for statuses and parameters and the conditions for checking them.\nIf a status is not behaving normally or a parameter is outside the permitted tolerance values, consult the  corresponding fault finding page.\nCustomer complaints - Fault finding chart\nIf the test with the  diagnostic tool  is OK but the customer complaint is still present, the fault should be processed by  customer complaints .\nA summary of the overall procedure to follow is provided on the following page in the form of a flow chart.\n36B-3 V1 MR-453-X79-36B000$010.mif\nPOWER-ASSISTED STEERING PUMP ASSEMBLY Fault finding – Introduction 36B\n4.

FAULT FINDING PROCEDURE (CONTINUED)\nFault finding problems Disconnecting the connectors and/or manipulating the wiring may temporarily remove the cause of a fault.\nVisual inspection Look for damage under the bonnet and in the passenger compartment. Carefully check the protectors, insulation, and routing of the wiring, as well as the mountings.\nPhysical inspection While manipulating the wiring, use either the  diagnostic tool  to detect a change in status from “stored” to “present”,  or use the multimeter to view the status changes. Make sure that the connectors are properly locked. Apply light pressure to the connectors. Twist the wiring harness.\nChecking earth insulation This check is carried out by measuring the voltage (multimeter in voltmeter mode) between the suspect connection  and the  12 V  or  5 V . The correct measured value is  0 V.\nChecking insulation against + 12 V or + 5 V This check is carried out by measuring the voltage (multimeter in voltmeter mode) between the suspect connection  and the earth. In the first instance, the earth may be taken on the chassis. The correct measured value should be  0 V\nContinuity check A continuity check is carried out by measuring the resistance (multimeter in ohmmeter mode), with the connectors  disconnected at both ends. The expected result is  1  ΩΩΩΩ  ± 1  ΩΩΩΩ  for every connection. The line must be fully checked,  and the intermediate connections are only included in the method if this saves time during the fault finding  procedure. The continuity check on the multiplex lines must be carried out on both wires. The measured value  should be  1   Ω   ± 1   Ω .\nChecking the supply This check may be carried out using a test light ( 21 W  or  5 W  depending on the maximum authorised load).\n36B-5 V1 MR-453-X79-36B000$010.mif\nPOWER-ASSISTED STEERING PUMP ASSEMBLY Fault finding – Introduction 36B\n4.2 Checking the connectors\nNote: Carry out each requested check visually.  Do not remove a connector if it is not required.\nNote: Repeated connections and disconnections alter the functionality of the connectors and increase the risk of poor  electrical contact. Limit the number of connections/disconnections as much as possible.\nNote: The check is carried out on the 2 parts of the connection. There may be two types of connection: – Connector/Connector. – Connector/Device.\nVisual inspection of the connection: – Check that the connector is connected correctly and that the male and female parts of the connection are  correctly coupled.\nVisual inspection of the area around the connection: – Check the condition of the mounting (pin, strap, adhesive tape, etc.) if the connectors are attached to the  vehicle. – Check that there is no damage to the wiring trim (sheath, foam, adhesive tape, etc.) near the wiring. – Check that there is no damage to the electrical wires at the connector outputs, in particular on the insulating  material (wear, cuts, burns, etc.).\nDisconnect the connector to continue the checks.\nVisual inspection of the plastic casing: – Check that there is no mechanical damage (casing crushed, split, broken, etc.), in particular to the fragile  components (lever, lock, sockets, etc.). – Check that there is no heat damage (casing melted, darker, deformed, etc.). – Check that there are no stains (grease, mud, liquid, etc.).\nVisual inspection of the metal contacts: (The female contact is called CLIP. The male contact is called TAB). – Check that there are no bent contacts (the contact is not inserted correctly and can come out of the back of  the connector). The contact comes out of the connector when the wire is pulled gently. – Check that there is no damage (folded tabs, clips open too wide, blackened or melted contact, etc.). – Check that there is no oxidation on the metal contacts.\n36B-6 V1 MR-453-X79-36B000$010.mif\nPOWER-ASSISTED STEERING PUMP ASSEMBLY Fault finding – Introduction 36B\nVisual inspection of the sealing: (Only for watertight connectors) Check for the seal on the connection (between the 2 parts of the connection). – Check the seal at the back of the connectors: –  For  unit   joints (1 for each wire), check that the unit joints are present on each electrical wire and that they are  correctly positioned in the opening (level with the housing). Check that plugs are present on openings which  are not used. –  For a   grommet  seal (one seal which covers the entire internal surface of the connector), check that the seal is present. –  For  gel  seals, check for gel in all of the sockets without removing the excess or any protruding sections (it does not  matter if there is gel on the contacts). –  For  hotmelt  sealing (heat-shrink sheath with glue), check that the sheath has contracted correctly on the rear of the  connectors and the electrical wires, and that the hardened glue comes out of the side of the wire. – Check that there is no damage to any of the seals (cuts, burns, significant deformation, etc.).\nIf a fault is detected, consult  Technical Note 6015A, Repairing electrical wiring.\n36B-7 V1 MR-453-X79-36B000$010.mif\nPOWER-ASSISTED STEERING PUMP ASSEMBLY Fault finding – Introduction 36B\nIMPORTANT Any fault on a complex system requires thorough fault finding with the appropriate tools. The  FAULT FINDING LOG, which should be completed during the fault finding procedure, ensures a  record is kept of the procedure carried out. It is an essential document when consulting the  manufacturer.\nIT IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL THAT THE FAULT FINDING LOG IS FILLED OUT EVERY TIME IT IS  REQUESTED BY TECHLINE OR THE WARRANTY RETURNS DEPARTMENT.\nYou will always be asked for this log: – when requesting technical assistance from Techline, – for approval requests when replacing parts for which approval is mandatory, – to be attached to monitored parts for which reimbursement is requested. The log is needed for warranty  reimbursement, and enables better analysis of the parts removed.\n6. SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS\nSafety rules must be observed during any work on a component to prevent any material damage or personal injury: – check the battery voltage to avoid incorrect operation of computer functions, – use the proper tools.\nIt is forbidden to carry out a road test with the diagnostic tool in dialogue with the ECU because the ABS and  Electronic Brake Distribution functions are deactivated. Braking pressure is identical on both vehicle axles  (risk of a spin under heavy braking).\n36B-8 V1 MR-453-X79-36B000$010.mif\nPOWER-ASSISTED STEERING PUMP ASSEMBLY Fault finding – List and location of components\nLocation of components\n1 Power-assisted steering pump assembly 4 Diagnostic socket\n2 Engine interconnection unit 5 Alternator\n3 Passenger compartment fuse box\n36B-9 V1 MR-453-X79-36B000$020.mif\nPOWER-ASSISTED STEERING PUMP ASSEMBLY Fault finding – Function\nPower-assisted steering pump assembly\n1 Oil reservoir 4 Computer\n2 Hydraulic pump (in tank) 5 Signal connector\n3 Power connector 6 Electric motor\n36B-10 V1 MR-453-X79-36B000$030.mif\nPOWER-ASSISTED STEERING PUMP ASSEMBLY Fault finding – Function 36B\nPower-assisted steering:  The power-assisted steering system uses a pump assembly which generates the hydraulic pressure assistance in  the steering circuit.\nOperation of the power-assisted steering is managed by a computer integrated into the pump assembly of the  power-assisted steering. Correct system operation is checked using sensors integrated into the pump assembly of the power-assisted  steering.\nThe power-assisted steering is only available when the  + after ignition feed  is on (computer activation) and the  vehicle's engine is running (the presence of the alternator signal is interpreted by the computer as \"engine running\"). The power-assisted steering is only switched off if the after ignition feed and alternator signal disappear and the  speed is less than  2 mph (3 km/h) .\nThe level of assistance calculated is based on parameters defined by Renault (tuning or assistance strategy) and  stored in the computer memory. This assistance strategy should be entered after replacing the  pump assembly* of  DUSTER .\n• When the vehicle speed is absent, or received but invalid, then the level of assistance provided corresponds to the  level of assistance for  60 mph (100km/h) . In this case, power-assisted steering is available but is not optimal.  Heavy steering is easily perceived when stationary. The higher the vehicle speed, the more limited the power-assisted steering assistance.  The  DUSTER GEP*  is  a variable power-assisted steering system, which varies according to the vehicle speed.\n• The assistance is available more or less immediately when the vehicle is started. Two cases can be identified: – The ignition is on but the engine is not started immediately. This allows time for the GEP* to perform its  initialisation sequence ( 500 ms  approximately). As soon as the engine is  running , the GEP* supplies  assistance with a gradient of  100%/s . – The ignition is on and the engine is started immediately. The GEP* starts the initialisation phase  immediately followed by a gradient of  100%/s .\nThe power-assisted steering can be maintained in degraded mode then reduced gradually for the following  5  minutes  until assistance stops completely. This particular mode is active when the signal connector is disconnected.\nFault finding only operates when the  GEP  supply voltage is between 9 V  and 18 V . Abnormal levels of voltage, which  are out of range, may generate noticeable variations in assistance.\n36B-11 V1 MR-453-X79-36B000$030.mif\nPOWER-ASSISTED STEERING PUMP ASSEMBLY Fault finding – Function 36B\n• Temperature Protection Function\nThe temperature of the pump assembly is monitored by two sensors, one for the oil temperature, the other for the  temperature of the internal electronics.\nThere are two possible cases: • When at least one of the two temperatures ( PR008 COMPUTER TEMPERATURE and PR016 OIL  TEMPERATURE ) exceeds the threshold of  107˚C , the rotation speed of the electric motor decreases  until  the temperature drops below this threshold.  • When at least one of the two temperatures ( PR008 COMPUTER TEMPERATURE  and  PR016 OIL  TEMPERATURE ) exceeds the threshold of  125˚C , the electric pump switches off and no assistance is  provided for as long as it takes for the temperature to return below this threshold.\n• Fault finding function\nThe pump assembly computer includes a self-test procedure function. The required information can be accessed  using the  diagnostic tool , by the  HK  line.\n36B-12 V1 MR-453-X79-36B000$030.mif\nPOWER-ASSISTED STEERING PUMP ASSEMBLY Fault finding – Configuration\nConfigurations of the power-assisted steering function\nConfiguration readings available using the  diagnostic tool :\nConfiguration  reading Name of configuration Option Configuration\nLC005 Computer calibration K9K  VP006\n• Check the configurations in the  Read configurations  menu\n36B-13 V1 MR-453-X79-36B000$040.mif\nPOWER-ASSISTED STEERING PUMP ASSEMBLY Fault finding – Programming\nVP001: Write VIN.

PREREQUISITES FOR FAULT FINDING\nFault finding procedures  (this document): – Assisted fault finding (integrated into the  diagnostic tool ), Dialogys.\nWiring Diagrams: – Visu-Schéma.\nType of diagnostic tools\nSpecial tooling required\nSpecial tooling required:\nTo run fault finding on the vehicle computers, switch on the ignition. Proceed as follows: – turn the ignition key to APC, – connect the diagnostic tool and perform the required operations.\nTo  cut off the + after ignition feed , proceed as follows: – disconnect the diagnostic tool, – turn the ignition key to OFF, – verify that the forced + after ignition feed has been switched off by checking that the computer warning  lights on the control panel have gone out.\n38C-2 V1 MR-453-X79-38C000$010.mif\nABS BOSCH 8.1 Vdiag No.: 04\nANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM\nFault finding – Introduction 38C\nFaults are declared present or stored (depending on whether they appeared in a certain context and have  disappeared since, or whether they remain present but are not diagnosed within the current context).\nConsider the fault status,  present  or  stored  when the  diagnostic tool  is used after the + after ignition feed  (without operating the system components).\nFor a  present fault , apply the procedure described in the Interpretation of faults section. For a  stored fault , note the faults displayed and apply the Notes section.\nIf the fault is  confirmed  when the instructions are applied, the fault is present. Deal with the fault. If the fault is  not confirmed , check: – the electrical connections that correspond to the fault, – the connectors for this connection, – the resistance of the faulty component, – the condition of the wires. Refer to paragraphs 4.1 Checking wiring and 4.2 Checking connectors\nThe aim of the conformity check is to check data that does not produce a fault on the  diagnostic tool  when the data  is inconsistent. Therefore, this stage is used to:  – carry out fault finding on faults that do not have a fault display, and which may correspond to a customer complaint, – check that the system is operating correctly and that there is no risk of a fault recurring after repairs.\nThis section gives the fault finding procedures for statuses and parameters and the conditions for checking them.\nIf a status is not behaving normally or a parameter is outside the permitted tolerance values, consult the  corresponding fault finding page.\nCustomer complaints - Fault finding chart\nIf the test with the  diagnostic tool  is OK but the customer complaint is still present, the fault should be processed by  customer complaints .\nA summary of the overall procedure to follow is provided on the following page in the form of a flow chart.\n38C-3 V1 MR-453-X79-38C000$010.mif\nABS BOSCH 8.1 Vdiag No.: 04\nANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM\nFault finding – Introduction 38C\n4.

FAULT FINDING PROCEDURE (CONTINUED)\nFault finding problems Disconnecting the connectors and/or manipulating the wiring may temporarily remove the cause of a fault.\nVisual inspection Look for damage under the bonnet and in the passenger compartment. Carefully check the protectors, insulation, and routing of the wiring, as well as the mountings.\nPhysical inspection While manipulating the wiring, use either the  diagnostic tool  to detect a change in status from \"stored\" to \"present\",  or use the multimeter to view the status changes. Make sure that the connectors are properly locked. Apply light pressure to the connectors. Twist the wiring harness.\nChecking earth insulation This check is carried out by measuring the voltage (multimeter in voltmeter mode) between the suspect connection  and the  12 V  or  5 V . The correct measured value is  0 V .\nChecking insulation against + 12 V or + 5 V This check is carried out by measuring the voltage (multimeter in voltmeter mode) between the suspect  connection and the earth. In the first instance, the earth may be taken on the chassis. The correct measured  value should be  0 V\nContinuity check A continuity check is carried out by measuring the resistance (multimeter in ohmmeter mode), with the connectors  disconnected at both ends. The expected result is  1  ΩΩΩΩ  ± 1  ΩΩΩΩ  for every connection. The line must be fully checked,  and the intermediate connections are only included in the method if this saves time during the fault finding  procedure. The continuity check on the multiplex lines must be carried out on both wires. The measured value  should be  1  ΩΩΩΩ  ± 1  ΩΩΩΩ .\nChecking the supply This check may be carried out using a test light ( 21 W  or  5 W  depending on the maximum authorised load).\n38C-5 V1 MR-453-X79-38C000$010.mif\nABS BOSCH 8.1 Vdiag No.: 04\nANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM\nFault finding – Introduction 38C\n4.2 Checking the connectors\nNote: Carry out each requested check visually.  Do not remove a connector if it is not required.\nNote: Repeated connections and disconnections alter the functionality of the connectors and increase the risk of poor  electrical contact. Limit the number of connections/disconnections as much as possible.\nNote: The check is carried out on the 2 parts of the connection. There may be two types of connection: – Connector/Connector. – Connector/Device.\nVisual inspection of the connection: – Check that the connector is connected correctly and that the male and female parts of the connection are correctly  coupled.\nVisual inspection of the area around the connection: – Check the condition of the mounting (pin, strap, adhesive tape, etc.) if the connectors are attached to the vehicle. – Check that there is no damage to the wiring trim (sheath, foam, adhesive tape, etc.) near the wiring. – Check that there is no damage to the electrical wires at the connector outputs, in particular on the insulating material  (wear, cuts, burns, etc.).\nDisconnect the connector to continue the checks.\nVisual inspection of the plastic casing: – Check that there is no mechanical damage (casing crushed, split, broken, etc.), in particular to the fragile  components (lever, lock, sockets, etc.). – Check that there is no heat damage (casing melted, darker, deformed, etc.). – Check that there are no stains (grease, mud, liquid, etc.).\nVisual inspection of the metal contacts: (The female contact is called CLIP. The male contact is called TAB). – Check that there are no bent contacts (the contact is not inserted correctly and can come out of the back of the  connector). The contact comes out of the connector when the wire is pulled gently. – Check that there is no damage (folded tabs, clips open too wide, blackened or melted contact, etc.). – Check that there is no oxidation on the metal contacts.\n38C-6 V1 MR-453-X79-38C000$010.mif\nABS BOSCH 8.1 Vdiag No.: 04\nANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM\nFault finding – Introduction 38C\nVisual inspection of the sealing: (Only for watertight connectors) Check for the seal on the connection (between the 2 parts of the connection). – Check the seal at the back of the connectors: – For  unit  joints (1 for each wire), check that the unit joints are present on each electrical wire and that they  are correctly positioned in the opening (level with the housing). Check that plugs are present on openings  which are not used. – For a  grommet  seal (one seal which covers the entire internal surface of the connector), check that the seal  is present. – For gel seals, check for gel in all of the sockets without removing the excess or any protruding sections  (it does not matter if there is gel on the contacts). – For  hotmelt  sealing (heat-shrink sheath with glue), check that the sheath has contracted correctly on the  rear of the connectors and the electrical wires, and that the hardened glue comes out of the side of the wire. – Check that there is no damage to any of the seals (cuts, burns, significant deformation, etc.).\nIf a fault is detected, consult  Technical Note 6015A, Repairing electrical wiring .\n38C-7 V1 MR-453-X79-38C000$010.mif\nABS BOSCH 8.1 Vdiag No.: 04\nANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM\nFault finding – Introduction 38C\nIMPORTANT Any fault on a complex system requires thorough fault finding with the appropriate tools.  The FAULT FINDING LOG, which should be completed during the fault finding procedure,  ensures a record is kept of the procedure carried out. It is an essential document when  consulting the manufacturer.\nIT IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL THAT THE FAULT FINDING LOG IS FILLED OUT EVERY TIME IT IS  REQUESTED BY TECHLINE OR THE WARRANTY RETURNS DEPARTMENT.\nYou will always be asked for this log: – when requesting technical assistance from Techline, – for approval requests when replacing parts for which approval is mandatory, – to be attached to monitored parts for which reimbursement is requested. The log is needed for warranty  reimbursement, and enables better analysis of the parts removed.\n6. SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS\nSafety rules must be observed during any work on a component to prevent any material damage or personal injury: – check the battery voltage to avoid incorrect operation of computer functions, – use the proper tools.\nIt is forbidden to carry out a road test with the diagnostic tool in dialogue with the ECU because the ABS and  Electronic Brake Distribution functions are deactivated. Braking pressure is identical on both vehicle axles  (risk of a spin under heavy braking).\n38C-8 V1 MR-453-X79-38C000$010.mif\nABS BOSCH 8.1 Vdiag No.: 04\nANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM\nFault finding – List and location of components\nThe anti-lock braking system consists of: – four wheel speed sensors (1), – a longitudinal acceleration sensor (ABS 4X4) (2), – a brake pedal sensor (3), – a pump assembly (4) consisting of: • a hydraulic pump, • a pressure modulation unit (eight solenoid valves), • a computer, • a pressure sensor.\n38C-9 V1 MR-453-X79-38C000$020.mif\nABS BOSCH 8.1 Vdiag No.: 04\nANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM\nFault finding – Role of components\nGives the speed of each of the vehicle's wheels.

In case of poor traction, the wheels can tend to slow down and slip,  resulting in a loss of vehicle stability. The  MSR  requests the engine to increase its torque to prevent the drive wheels from locking.\nThe  ABS  prevents the wheels from locking when braking. This function allows the vehicle to be steered under  braking and ensures vehicle stability under braking.\nEBD (electronic braking distribution):\nThe electronic braking distribution unit optimises the brakeforce distribution between the front and rear axles.  This function ensures vehicle stability under braking.\nFault finding warning lights programming\nInstrument panel warning light Meaning\n- ABS ABS function inoperative.\nBrake faults ABS and STOP Electronic braking regulation and ABS  function not working\nBrake faults  flashing at  2 Hz ABS flashing at  2 Hz ABS computer is in fault finding mode.\n- ABS flashing at  8 Hz Tachometer index or vehicle  configuration not programmed.\n38C-15 V1 MR-453-X79-38C000$050.mif\nABS BOSCH 8.1 Vdiag No.: 04\nANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM\nFault finding – Programming\nVP001: Enter VIN .

Use parameters  PR001 Front right-hand wheel speed, PR002 Front left-hand wheel speed, PR003 Rear  right-hand wheel speed  and  PR004 Rear left-hand wheel speed  by turning the relevant wheels and checking  the consistency of the results obtained. If the value measured is zero, rotate the other wheels to confirm an electrical inversion of the sensors and repair  the wiring harness. – Possible inversion of pipes on the hydraulic unit. Use commands  AC003 Front left-hand wheel solenoid valves, AC004 Front right-hand wheel solenoid  valves, AC005 Rear left-hand wheel solenoid valves  and  AC006 Rear right-hand wheel solenoid valves   while depressing the brake pedal and check for the occurrence of locking/unlocking cycles on the wheel  concerned (see  Command summary table ). If the cycles do not occur on the wheel tested (wheel remains  locked), check whether they occur on another wheel to confirm reversed pipes. If the cycles do not occur on one wheel and the pipes have not been inverted, contact the Techline.\nCheck that the wheel speed sensor mounting is in good condition (clipping). Visually inspect the condition of the target (clogging, metallic contamination, etc.) and clean with compressed air  if necessary.

FAULT FINDING PROCEDURE\nNote: Carry out each requested check visually. Do not remove a connector if it is not required.\nNote: Repeated connections and disconnections alter the functionality of the connectors and increase the risk of poor  electrical contact. Limit the number of connections/disconnections as much as possible.\nNote: The check is carried out on the 2 parts of the connection. There may be two types of connection: – Connector / Connector – Connector / Device\nFault finding problems Disconnecting the connectors and/or manipulating the wiring may temporarily clear the cause of a fault. Electrical measurements of voltage, resistance and insulation are generally correct, especially if the fault is not  present when the analysis is made (stored fault).\nVisual inspection of the connection: • Check that the connector is connected correctly and that the male and female parts of the connection are correctly  coupled.\nVisual inspection of the area around the connection: • Check the condition of the mounting (pin, strap, adhesive tape, etc.) if the connectors are attached to the vehicle. • Check that there is no damage to the wiring trim (sheath, foam, adhesive tape, etc.) near the wiring. • Check that there is no damage to the electrical wires at the connector outputs, in particular on the insulating material  (wear, cuts, burns, etc.).\nDisconnect the connector to continue the checks.\nVisual inspection of the plastic casing: • Check that there is no mechanical damage (casing crushed, cracked, broken, etc.), in particular to the fragile  components (lever, lock, openings, etc.). • Check that there is no heat damage (casing melted, darker, deformed, etc.). • Check that there are no stains (grease, mud, liquid, etc.).\nVisual inspection of the metal contacts: (The female contact is called CLIP. The male contact is called TAB). • Check that there are no bent contacts (the contact is not inserted correctly and can come out of the back of the  connector). The spring contact of the connector when the wire is gently pulled. • Check that there is no damage (folded tabs, clips open too wide, blackened or melted contact, etc.). • Check that there is no oxidation on the metal contacts.\n61A-3 V1 MR-453-X79-61A000$010.mif\nFault finding – Introduction 61A\nVisual inspection of the sealing: (Only for watertight connectors) • Check for the seal on the connection (between the 2 parts of the connection). • Check the seal at the back of the connectors: –  For unit  joints (1 for each wire), check that the unit joints are present on each electrical wire and that they  are correctly positioned in the opening (level with the housing). Check that plugs are present on openings  which are not used. – For a  grommet  seal (one seal which covers the entire internal surface of the connector), check that the seal  is present. – For  gel  seals, check for gel in all of the openings without removing the excess or any protruding sections  (it does not matter if there is gel on the contacts). – For  hotmelt  sealing (heat-shrink sheath with glue), check that the sheath has contracted correctly on the  rear of the connectors and electrical wires, and that the hardened glue comes out of the side of the wire. • Check that there is no damage to any of the seals (cuts, burns, significant deformation, etc.).\nIf a fault is detected, repair or replace the wiring (see  Technical Note 6015A, Electrical wiring repair, Wiring:  Precautions for repair )\n61A-4 V1 MR-453-X79-61A000$010.mif\nFault finding – Introduction 61A\nIMPORTANT All faults involving a complex system call for thorough diagnostics with the appropriate tools.  The FAULT FINDING LOG, which should be completed during the fault finding procedure,  ensures a record is kept of the procedure carried out. It is an essential document when  consulting the manufacturer.\nIT IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL THAT THE FAULT FINDING LOG IS FILLED OUT EVERY TIME IT IS  REQUESTED BY TECHLINE OR THE WARRANTY RETURNS DEPARTMENT\nYou will always be asked for this log: • when requesting technical assistance from the Techline, • when requesting approval before replacing parts for which approval is compulsory, • to be attached to monitored parts for which reimbursement is requested. The log is needed for warranty  reimbursement, and enables better analysis of the parts removed.\n6. SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS\nSafety rules must be observed during any work on a component to prevent any material damage or personal injury: – check the battery voltage to avoid incorrect operation of computer functions, – do not smoke, – use the proper tools.\n61A-5 V1 MR-453-X79-61A000$010.mif\nFault finding – List and location of components\n1. Without Passenger Compartment Heating Resistors\n2. With Passenger Compartment Heating Resistors\nPassenger compartment fan unit\n–  Heater matrix:  This is located at the bottom of the heating and air conditioning unit.\n–  Passenger compartment heating resistors:  These are located at the bottom of the heater matrix on  the driver's side (depending on the equipment).\n–  Air distribution flap:  This is located in the heating and air conditioning unit.\n–  Mixing flap:  This is located in the heating and air conditioning unit.\n–  Recirculation flap:  This is located behind the dashboard.\n–  Passenger compartment fan assembly:  This is located in the heating and air conditioning unit.\n–  Air pipes:  These are located underneath the dashboard.\n61A-6 V1 MR-453-X79-61A000$020.mif\nFault finding – Role of components\n–  Heater matrix:   The external air entering the heating and air conditioning device ( HVAC ) is heated by the  heater matrix . – Passenger Compartment Heating Resistors   ( depending on version ): The passenger compartment heating resistors are an electric heating system located in the passenger  compartment ventilation heating unit. This system acts as an additional heater which operates when the  engine is cold (when starting).\nPassenger Compartment Heating Resistors (RCH)\n– Air distribution flap: This flap enables the air flowing into the passenger compartment to be directed.\n– Air mixing flap: This flap enables the temperature requirements of the occupants to be met.\n– Recirculation flap: This flap prevents the entry of exterior air. In this case, the passenger compartment is isolated from the exterior  and air is blown in the passenger compartment in a closed circuit.\n– Passenger compartment blower unit:\nThe passenger compartment blower unit is controlled by the MVPR (Resistive Blower Dimmer Module).\n61A-7 V1 MR-453-X79-61A000$030.mif\nFault finding – Role of components 61A\nResistive Blower Dimmer Module (MVPR)\n1) Thermal fuse 2) Fan assembly connector 3) Connector to Control panel\nThe air flows into an open air inlet scoop towards the exterior. There must be enough air flow for it to be channelled  into the passenger compartment. This flow can be created by the vehicle speed (in non-recirculation mode) or by  activating the blower. The air flowing into the passenger compartment is protected by a grille and a rain shield in  order to prevent foreign bodies and water from entering. The air is then distributed inside the passenger  compartment.\n61A-8 V1 MR-453-X79-61A000$030.mif\nFault finding – Function\nS ummary of components controlled by the passenger compartment ventilation and heating  control panel:\nPassenger  compartment\nDistribution flap Mixing flap\nResistor unit Recirculation  flap\nUser request management  (heated rear screen button pressed)\nButton lighting (heated rear  screen button)\nPassenger compartment  fan operation signal  (running or stopped)\nTransmission of the request  to switch on the heated  rear screen.\nKey: Wire connections =  Mechanical connections =  (Cable controls)\n61A-9 V1 MR-453-X79-61A000$040.mif\nFault finding – Function 61A\nSummary of components controlled or managed by the UCH:\nExternal temperature sensor  (depending on version)\nRear screen de-icing and rear-view  mirror de-icer (depending on  version)\nActuator control Sensor management\nHeated rear screen control  management\nSummary diagram of components controlled or managed by the injection computer:\nEngine cooling fan assembly\nEngine coolant  temperature sensor\nPassenger  compartment  heating resistances  (RCH) relay No.1\nPassenger  compartment  heating resistances  (RCH) relay No.2\nActuator control Sensor management\nEngine injection computer\nManagement of the additional heater (heater resistor control) depending on the equipment.\nKey: Wire connections =\n61A-10 V1 MR-453-X79-61A000$040.mif\nFault finding – Function 61A\nLayout of the heating function:\nThe passenger compartment ventilation heating panel enables:\n– the passenger compartment blower unit to be activated, – the rear de-icing to be activated by the UCH.\nThe passenger compartment ventilation heating panel controls the air distribution, mixing and recirculation flaps  by cables.

SCOPE OF THIS DOCUMENT\nThis document presents the fault finding procedure applicable to all computers with the following specifications:\nFunction concerned:  Climate Control\n2. PREREQUISITES FOR FAULT FINDING\nFault finding procedures  (this document and the Technical Notes concerning the injection system fitted to  the vehicle, and the UCH): – Assisted fault finding (integrated into the  diagnostic tool ), Dialogys. Wiring Diagrams: – Visu-Schéma (CD-ROM), paper.\nType of diagnostic tools – CLIP + CAN sensor\nSpecial tooling required\nSpecial tooling required\nElé. 1681  Universal bornier\nTo run fault finding on the vehicle computers, proceed as follows: – turn the ignition key to APC, – connect the  diagnostic tool  and perform the required operations,\nTo cut off the + after ignition feed, proceed as follows: – disconnect the  diagnostic tool , – turn the ignition key to OFF, – switch off the ignition.\n62C-2 V1 MR-453-X79-62C000$010.mif\nFault finding – Introduction 62C\nFaults are declared present or stored (depending on whether they appeared in a certain context and have  disappeared since, or whether they remain present but are not diagnosed within the current context). The  present  or  stored  status of the fault should be considered when   the diagnostic tool is switched on after  the + after ignition feed is switched on (without any action on the system components).\nFor a  present fault , apply the procedure described in the  Interpretation of faults  section. For a  stored fault , note the faults displayed and apply the  Notes  section. If the fault is  confirmed  when the instructions are applied, the fault is present. Deal with the fault.\nIf the fault is  not confirmed , check: – the electrical lines which correspond to the fault, – the connectors on these lines (corrosion, bent pins, etc.), – the resistance of the faulty component, – the condition of the wires (melted or split insulation, wear).\nThe aim of the conformity check is to check data that does not produce a fault on the  diagnostic tool  when the data  is inconsistent. Therefore, this stage is used to:\n– carry out fault finding on faults that do not have a fault display, and which may correspond to a customer  complaint, – check that the system is operating correctly and that there is no risk of a fault recurring after repairs.\nThis section gives the fault finding procedures for statuses and parameters and the conditions for checking them. If a status is not behaving normally or a parameter is outside the permitted tolerance values, consult the  corresponding fault finding page.\n62C-3 V1 MR-453-X79-62C000$010.mif\nFault finding – Introduction 62C\nSpecial notes on the conformity check for the air conditioning function:\nThe  air conditioning system  conformity check is divided into four parts. The parts relate to the four sub-functions of  the air conditioning system: heating, cold loop, user selection and passenger compartment ventilation. The statuses  and parameters related to these sub-functions are listed with their respective computers.\nSpecial notes:  The air conditioning control panel does not control electrical components (other than the passenger  compartment fan assembly) and it cannot support fault finding.\nNote: The interpretation of statuses, parameters and commands is also split into several sections. Everything controlled  by the air conditioning control panel is explained in the two  Air conditioning  sections ( 62B and 62C ). On the other  hand, signals from other computers are explained in the fault finding sections for these computers (see  conformity  check ).\nCustomer complaints - Fault finding chart\nIf the test with the  diagnostic tool  is OK but the customer complaint is still present, the fault should be processed by  customer complaints .\nA synopsis of the general procedure to follow is provided on the following page in the form of a flow chart.\n62C-4 V1 MR-453-X79-62C000$010.mif\nFault finding – Introduction 62C\n4.

FAULT FINDING PROCEDURE (continued)\nNote: Carry out each requested check visually. Do not remove a connector if it is not required.\nNote: Repeated connections and disconnections alter the functionality of the connectors and increase the risk of poor  electrical contact. Limit the number of connections/disconnections as much as possible.\nNote: The check is carried out on the 2 parts of the connection. There may be two types of connection: – Connector / Connector – Connector / Device\nFault finding problems Disconnecting the connectors and/or manipulating the wiring may temporarily remove the cause of a fault. Electrical measurements of voltage, resistance and insulation are generally correct, especially if the fault is not  present when the analysis is made (stored fault).\nVisual inspection of the connection: • Check that the connector is connected correctly and that the male and female parts of the connection are  correctly coupled.\nVisual inspection of the area around the connection: • Check the condition of the mounting (pin, strap, adhesive tape, etc.), that the connectors are attached to the  vehicle. • Check that there is no damage to the wiring trim (sheath, foam, adhesive tape, etc.) near the wiring. • Check that there is no damage to the electrical wires at the connector outputs, in particular on the insulating  material (wear, cuts, burns, etc.).\nDisconnect the connector to continue the checks.\nVisual inspection of the plastic casings: • Check that there is no mechanical damage (casing crushed, cracked, broken, etc.), in particular to the fragile  components (lever, lock, openings, etc.). • Check that there is no heat damage (casing melted, darker, deformed, etc.). • Check that there are no stains (grease, mud, liquid, etc.).\nVisual inspection of the metal contacts: (The female contact is called CLIP. The male contact is called TAB). • Check that there are no bent contacts (the contact is not inserted correctly and can come out of the back of  the connector). The spring contact of the connector when pulling the wire slightly. • Check that there is no damage (folded tabs, clips open too wide, blackened or melted contact, etc.). • Check that there is no oxidation on the metal contacts.\n62C-6 V1 MR-453-X79-62C000$010.mif\nFault finding – Introduction 62C\nVisual inspection of the sealing: (Only for watertight connectors) • Check for the seal on the connection (between the 2 parts of the connection). • Check the seal at the back of the connectors: – For  unit  joints (1 for each wire), check that the unit joints are present on each electrical wire and that they  are correctly positioned in the opening (level with the housing). Check that plugs are present on openings  which are not used. – For a  grommet  seal (one seal which covers the entire internal surface of the connector), check that the  seal is present. – For  gel  seals, check for gel in all of the sockets without removing the excess or any protruding sections  (it does not matter if there is gel on the contacts). – For  hotmelt  sealing (heat-shrink sheath with glue), check that the sheath has contracted correctly on the  rear of the connectors and electrical wires, and that the hardened glue comes out of the side of the wire. • Check that there is no damage to any of the seals (cuts, burns, significant deformation, etc.).\nIf a fault is detected, repair or replace the wiring (see  Technical Note 6015A, Electrical wiring repair, Wiring:  Precautions for repair )\n62C-7 V1 MR-453-X79-62C000$010.mif\nFault finding – Introduction 62C\nIMPORTANT Any fault on a complex system requires thorough fault finding with the appropriate tools.  The FAULT FINDING LOG, which should be completed during the fault finding procedure,  ensures a record is kept of the procedure carried out. It is an essential document when  consulting the manufacturer.\nIT IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL THAT THE FAULT FINDING LOG IS FILLED OUT EVERY TIME IT IS  REQUESTED BY TECHLINE OR THE WARRANTY RETURNS DEPARTMENT.\nYou will always be asked for this log: • when requesting technical assistance from Techline, • for approval requests when replacing parts for which approval is mandatory, • to be attached to monitored parts for which reimbursement is requested. The log is needed for warranty  reimbursement, and enables better analysis of the parts removed.\n6. SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS\nSafety rules must be observed during any work on a component to prevent any material damage or personal injury: – check the battery voltage to avoid incorrect operation of computer functions, – do not smoke, – use the proper tools.\n62C-8 V1 MR-453-X79-62C000$010.mif\nFault finding – List and location of components\nSystem (cold loop, hot loop and components)\n1) Air conditioning unit 2) Heater matrix 3) Expansion valve and evaporator 4) Coolant circuit 5) Cold loop 6) Condenser and radiator 7) Compressor\n• COLD LOOP COMPONENTS:\n–  Compressor : This is located at the bottom on the left-hand side, next to the radiator in the engine compartment.\n–  Condenser:  This is located between the radiator and the cooling fan assembly.\n–  Dehydrator reservoir : This is located on the left-hand side of the condenser outlet.\n–  Heating and air conditioning assembly : This is located underneath the dashboard.\n–  Thermostatic expansion valve : This is located to the left of the heating and air conditioning assembly on  the bulkhead.\n–  Evaporator : This is located to the right of the  thermostatic expansion valve  in the heating and air conditioning  assembly.\n–  High pressure pipe : This pipe connects the compressor, condenser, dehydrator reservoir and expansion valve  inlet in series (it is located in the engine compartment on the left-hand side).\n62C-9 V1 MR-453-X79-62C000$020.mif\nFault finding – List and location of components 62C\n–  Low pressure pipe : This pipe connects the expansion valve, buffering capacity, evaporator and compressor inlet  in series (it is located in the engine compartment on the left-hand side).\n–  Heater matrix:  This is located at the bottom of the   heating and air conditioning assembly.\n–  Heating resistors : These are located at the bottom of the heater matrix on the driver's side (depending on  the equipment).\n–  Air distribution flap:  This is located in the heating and air conditioning assembly.\n–  Mixing flap:  This is located in the heating and air conditioning assembly.\n–  Recirculation flap : This is located behind the dashboard.\n–  Passenger compartment fan assembly:  This is located in the heating and air conditioning assembly.\n–  Cooling fan assembly:  This is located in the front panel of the vehicle, in front of the condenser.\n–  Air pipes : These are located underneath the dashboard.\n62C-10 V1 MR-453-X79-62C000$020.mif\nFault finding – Role of components\n• COLD LOOP COMPONENTS\n1) Air conditioning unit 2) Heater matrix 3) Expansion valve and evaporator 4) Coolant circuit 5) Cold loop 6) Condenser and radiator 7) Compressor\n62C-11 V1 MR-453-X79-62C000$030.mif\nFault finding – Role of components 62C\nFigure 1: System assembly\nThe compressor is not activated when the exterior temperature is less than  3˚C , it is used to compress  the refrigerant into gas. The pressure can reach up to  28 bar .\n– Condenser: The condenser is composed of flat horizontal aluminium tubes. The pipes are divided by the vanes in order  to increase the air heat exchange and therefore cool the refrigerant fluid to produce condensation.\n1) Condenser 2) Dehydrator reservoir\n62C-12 V1 MR-453-X79-62C000$030.mif\nFault finding – Role of components 62C\n– Dehydrator reservoir: (see figure above)\nThe dehydrator reservoir is used to: • Check the condition of the refrigerant. • Absorb the variations in volume (expansion bottle principle). • Filter impurities. • Absorb moisture (water in the circuit).\n– Heating and air conditioning assembly: (see figure above)\nThis unit acts as an air mixing box. It is equipped with a system of flaps which allow the air to be directed in  accordance with the requirements of the occupants whilst simultaneously allowing the temperature of the air  entering the passenger compartment to be modified by mixing hot and cold air.\n– Thermostatic expansion valve: (see figure below)\nThis thermostatic-type expansion valve is used to check refrigerant expansion. It is located at the  evaporator inlet.\n– Evaporator: (see figure below)\n• The evaporator is a heat exchanger which enables the air entering the passenger compartment to be cooled.\nNote: Condensation of the air may occur thereby causing normal drops of water to form underneath the  vehicle body.\n1) Expansion valve 2) Evaporator\n62C-13 V1 MR-453-X79-62C000$030.mif\nFault finding – Role of components 62C\n– High and low pressure pipes:\n• The  High Pressure  and  Low Pressure  pipes are composed of rigid aluminium pipes and flexible pipes which  enable engine-related movements to be absorbed.\n• Two filler valves (on the  High Pressure  pipe and on the  Low Pressure  pipe) can be accessed in order to fill  (or drain) the refrigerant loop.\n• The connections must be checked in the event of a refrigerant fluid leak.\n1) Buffering capacity 2) Expansion valve outlet 3) Expansion valve inlet 4) High pressure filler valve 5) Low pressure filler valve 6) Condenser inlet 7) Condenser outlet 8) Pressure sensor 9) Compressor inlet 10) Compressor outlet\nFigure 6: Cold loop pipes\n– Heater matrix:  The external air entering the heating and air conditioning system ( HVAC ) is heated by the  heater matrix .\n62C-14 V1 MR-453-X79-62C000$030.mif\nFault finding – Role of components 62C\n– Passenger compartment heating resistors (depending on the equipment level):  The passenger compartment heating resistors (RCH) are electrical heating devices in the air conditioning unit.  This system is an additional heating system which operates when the engine is cold (when starting).\n– Air distribution flap:\nThis flap enables the air flowing into the passenger compartment to be directed.\nThis flap mixes the air in order to meet the temperature requirements of the occupants.\n– Recirculation flap:\nThis flap prevents the entry of exterior air. In this case, the passenger compartment is isolated from the  exterior and air is blown in the passenger compartment in a closed circuit.\nThese three flaps are  controlled by a cable .\n– Passenger compartment blower unit:\nThe passenger compartment fan assembly is controlled by the Resistive Blower Dimmer Module ( MVPR ).\n62C-15 V1 MR-453-X79-62C000$030.mif\nFault finding – Role of components 62C\nResistive Blower Dimmer Module (MVPR)\n1) Thermal fuse 2) Fan assembly connector 3) Connector to Control panel\nThe passenger compartment fan assembly is used to vary the rate at which air is blown into the passenger  compartment, depending on the requirements of the customer.\n– Cooling fan assembly:\nThe cooling fan assembly motor is normally used in order to promote heat exchange in the condenser and  therefore improve the performance of the air conditioning system. Activation of the air conditioning fan unit  depends, among other things, on the vehicle speed and high pressure in the loop.\nThe air flows into an open air inlet scoop towards the exterior. Therefore there must be enough air flow for it  to be channelled into the passenger compartment. This flow can be created by the vehicle speed (in non- recirculation mode) or by activating the blower. The air flowing into the passenger compartment is protected  by a grille and a rain shield in order to prevent foreign bodies and water from entering.

A discharged battery must be recharged using a Renault-approved battery charger (see  Technical Note 6512A  Battery charging )\n● Simultaneous recharging of several batteries in series or in parallel is forbidden.\n● A battery charger used on a battery connected to a vehicle can irreparably damage the vehicle computers due  to the high voltages created when charging.\n● The location of the charger must take this into account (ventilation).\n● A battery charger or a booster not approved by Renault can damage the electrical components.\nEven when stored off the vehicle, a battery gradually discharges, and more rapidly if the ambient temperature is  high. In order that a battery remains operational for a long time, it must be stored at a temperature of around  15˚C  and protected from humidity. To retain a good level of charge, it is recommended that a battery is completely  recharged after it has been stored for 3 months. A new battery that has been stored for more than one year must not be fitted to a vehicle.\n80A-3 V1 MR-453-X79-80A000$020.mif\nTest procedure using the MIDTRONICS tool\nSpecial tooling required\nElé. 1593 Battery tester\nThe measurement must be taken when the vehicle is stationary and the ignition is off.\nIf the engine has been run in the last hour, switch the battery status to test and carry out the following operations:  – engine switched off,  – switch on the main beam headlights for  2 minutes , – switch off the main beam headlights, – wait for  2 minutes , – switch off the ignition.\nEquipment to be used:\n– Tester approved by the Service Department: MIDTRONICS MICRO R330. – Tool available as part no.: Elé. 1593. – Equipment available in France from the Parts Department.  – Tool available in 6 languages.  – For other countries, consult your contact in your country.\nWARNING Failure to observe the procedure or poorly maintained equipment may result in incorrect measurements, which  could be:  – detrimental to the customer (the battery is not sound), – detrimental to RENAULT (unnecessary replacement of a sound or rechargeable battery), – detrimental to the dealership (if the battery is tested as sound or rechargeable for a part return under warranty,  the warranty reimbursement request will be cancelled).\n80A-4 V1 MR-453-X79-80A000$030.mif\nMode (test on vehicle)\n– Connect the tool directly to the battery terminals, without disconnecting the vehicle battery, as close as possible to  the battery terminal but ensuring it is not after the fuse (on-vehicle test) or carry out the battery test after  disconnecting the two terminals if necessary, – check that the vehicle ignition is switched off, – select the \"battery connected to the vehicle\" or \"battery disconnected\" test type using buttons   and  .

APPLICABILITY OF THE DOCUMENT\nThis document presents the fault finding method applicable to all computers with the following specifications:\nVehicle:   DUSTER Computer name:   UCH\nFunction concerned:   ACCESS/SAFETY Vdiag No.:  09\n2. PREREQUISITES FOR FAULT FINDING\nFault finding procedures  (this manual): – Assisted fault finding (integrated into the  diagnostic tool ), – Dialogys.\nWiring Diagrams: – Visu-Schéma.\nType of diagnostic tools\nSpecial tooling required\nSpecial tooling required\nElé. 1681 Universal bornier\nIf the information obtained by the diagnostic tool requires checking electrical continuity, connect bornier  Elé. 1622 or universal bornier Elé. 1681.\nWARNING: – All tests with bornier  Elé. 1622  or  Elé. 1681  must be conducted with the battery disconnected. – The bornier is only designed to be used with a multimeter. Never supply the test points with  12 V .\n3. SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS\nThe safety instructions must be followed at all times when working on components, to avoid damage or injury:  – check the battery voltage to avoid incorrect operation of computer functions, – use the proper tools.\nProcedure for disconnecting the battery: – switch off the ignition, – switch off all electrical consumers, – Wait at least  1 minute  for the electronic systems to switch off, – disconnect the battery, starting with the negative terminal.\n82D-2 V1 MR-453-X79-82D000$010.mif\nFault finding – Introduction 82D\nFaults are declared present or stored (depending on whether they appeared in a certain context and have  disappeared since, or whether they remain present but are not diagnosed within the current context).\nThe  present  or  stored  status of faults should be taken into consideration when the  diagnostic tool  is used after the  + after ignition feed (without activating the system components).\nFor a  present fault , apply the procedure described in the Interpretation of faults section. For a  stored fault , note the faults displayed and apply the Notes section.\nIf the fault is  confirmed  when the instructions are applied, the fault is present. Deal with the fault. If the fault is  not confirmed , check: – the electrical connections that correspond to the fault, – the connectors for this connection, – the resistance of the faulty component, – the condition of the wires. Refer to paragraphs 4.1 Checking wiring and 4.2 Checking connectors\nThe aim of the conformity check is to check data which does not produce a fault on  the diagnostic tool  when the  data is inconsistent. Therefore, this stage is used to:  – carry out fault finding on faults that do not have a fault display, and which may correspond to a customer complaint, – check that the system is operating correctly and that there is no risk of a fault recurring after repair.\nThis section gives the fault finding procedures for statuses and parameters and the conditions for checking them.\nIf a status is not behaving normally or a parameter is outside permitted tolerance values, you should consult the  corresponding fault finding page.\nCustomer complaints - Fault finding chart\nIf the test with  the diagnostic tool  is OK but the customer complaint is still present, the fault should be dealt with by  customer complaints .\nA summary of the overall procedure to follow is provided on the following page in the form of a flow chart.\n82D-3 V1 MR-453-X79-82D000$010.mif\nFault finding – Introduction 82D\n4.

Carefully check the protectors, insulation, and routing of the wiring, as well as the mountings.\nPhysical inspection When manipulating the wiring, either use the  diagnostic tool  to detect a change in status, from \"stored\" to \"present\",  or the multimeter to view the status changes. Make sure that the connectors are firmly secured. Apply light pressure to the connectors. Twist the wiring harness.\nChecking earth insulation This check is carried out by measuring the voltage (multimeter in voltmeter mode) between the suspect connection  and the  12 V  or  5 V . The correct measured value is  0 V.\nChecking insulation against + 12 V or + 5 V This check is carried out by measuring the voltage (multimeter in voltmeter mode) between the suspect connection  and the earth. In the first instance, the earth may be taken on the chassis. The correct measured value should be  0 V\nContinuity check A continuity check is carried out by measuring the resistance (multimeter in ohmmeter mode), with the connectors  disconnected at both ends. The expected result is  1   Ω   ± 1   Ω   for each connection. The line must be fully checked,  and the intermediate connections are only included in the method if this saves time during the fault finding  procedure. The continuity check on the multiplex lines must be carried out on both wires. The measured value  should be  1  ΩΩΩΩ  ± 1  ΩΩΩΩ .\nChecking the supply This check may be carried out using a test light ( 21 W  or  5 W  depending on the maximum authorised load).\n82D-5 V1 MR-453-X79-82D000$010.mif\nFault finding – Introduction 82D\nNote: Carry out each requested check visually.  Do not remove a connector if it is not required.\nNote: Repeated connections and disconnections alter the functionality of the connectors and increase the risk of poor  electrical contact. Limit the number of connections/disconnections as much as possible.\nNote: The check is carried out on the 2 parts of the connection. There may be two types of connection: – Connector/Connector. – Connector/Device.\nVisual inspection of the connection: – Check that the connector is connected correctly and that the male and female parts of the connection are correctly  coupled.\nVisual inspection of the area around the connection: – Check the condition of the mounting (pin, strap, adhesive tape, etc.) if the connectors are attached to the vehicle. – Check that there is no damage to the wiring trim (sheath, foam, adhesive tape, etc.) near the wiring. – Check that there is no damage to the electrical wires at the connector outputs, in particular on the insulating material  (wear, cuts, burns, etc.).\nDisconnect the connector to continue the checks.\nVisual inspection of the plastic casing: – Check that there is no mechanical damage (casing crushed, cracked, broken, etc.), in particular to the fragile  components (lever, lock, openings, etc.). – Check that there is no heat damage (casing melted, darker, deformed, etc.). – Check that there are no stains (grease, mud, liquid, etc.).\n• Visual inspection of the metal contacts: (The female contact is called CLIP. The male contact is called TAB). – Check that there are no bent contacts (the contact is not inserted correctly and can come out of the back of the  connector). The contact comes out of the connector when the wire is pulled gently. – Check that there is no damage (folded tabs, clips open too wide, blackened or melted contact, etc.). – Check that there is no oxidation on the metal contacts.\n82D-6 V1 MR-453-X79-82D000$010.mif\nFault finding – Introduction 82D\n• Visual inspection of the sealing: (Only for watertight connectors) Check for the seal on the connection (between the 2 parts of the connection). – Check the seal at the back of the connectors: – For unit  joints   (1 for each wire), check that the unit joints are present on each electrical wire and that they are  correctly positioned in the opening (level with the housing). Check that plugs are present on openings which are  not used. – For a   grommet  seal (one seal which covers the entire internal surface of the connector), check that the seal is present. – For  gel  seals, check for gel in all of the openings without removing the excess or any protruding sections (it does not matter  if there is gel on the contacts). – For  hotmelt  sealing (heat-shrink sheath with glue), check that the sheath has contracted correctly on the rear of the  connectors and electrical wires, and that the hardened glue comes out of the side of the wire. – Check that there is no damage to any of the seals (cuts, burns, significant deformation, etc.).\nIf a fault is detected, consult  Technical Note 6015A, Repairing electrical wiring.\nIMPORTANT Any fault on a complex system requires thorough fault finding with the appropriate tools.  The FAULT FINDING LOG, which should be completed during the fault finding procedure,  ensures a record is kept of the procedure carried out. It is an essential document when  consulting the manufacturer.\nIT IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL THAT THE FAULT FINDING LOG IS FILLED OUT EVERY TIME IT IS  REQUESTED BY TECHLINE OR THE WARRANTY RETURNS DEPARTMENT.\nYou will always be asked for this log: – when requesting technical assistance from the Techline, – when requesting approval before replacing parts for which approval is compulsory, – to be attached to monitored parts for which reimbursement is requested. The log is needed for warranty  reimbursement, and enables better analysis of the parts removed.\n82D-7 V1 MR-453-X79-82D000$010.mif\nFault finding – List and location of components\n1 UCH 6 Passenger lock\n2 Passenger compartment fuse box 7  Rear left-hand lock\n3 Transponder ring 8 Rear right-hand lock\n4 Tailgate or boot lid lock 9 CPE* button\n5 Driver's lock CPE*: electric central door locking\n82D-8 V1 MR-453-X79-82D000$020.mif\nFault finding – Role of components\nElectric central door locking: The doors can be centrally locked and unlocked using the CPE* button.\nTailgate lock: The tailgate locking and unlocking function is controlled by the UCH.\nFront driver and passenger locks: The front driver and passenger door locking and unlocking command is provided by the UCH.\nTransponder and radiofrequency key: – the  transponder  in the key enables the following signals to be sent to the UCH: – Key identifier signal. – Immobiliser code signal. The transponder is also involved in the Immobiliser function.\nThe radiofrequency  key is used to transmit the key identifier information after pressing the button once. A  radiofrequency wave is sent to the UCH to carry out the user's request if the key is allocated to the vehicle (locking or  unlocking the doors and the tailgate).\nInjection When the authentication messages with the UCH have been exchanged, the injection can be unlocked and  authorise the starting of the engine. The injection system is unlocked and engine starting is authorised as soon as the UCH has authenticated  the injection computer.\nCPE*: electric central door locking.\n82D-9 V1 MR-453-X79-82D000$030.mif\nFault finding – Function\nThe immobiliser function is divided between three coded computers (the UCH, the injection computer and the key).  Communication between the key and the UCH is ensured by the transponder ring through a magnetic field created  between the transponder ring and the key.\nWhen the + After ignition is switched on, the key sends its identifier to the UCH via the transponder ring, located on  the ignition switch. The UCH runs through an authentication procedure with the key via the transponder ring. If the  key is allocated to the vehicle, then operation of the starter motor is authorised and the injection system is unlocked.\nThe injection computer has no reference code in its memory: the code which is transmitted is stored.\nIf the code supplied by the key is not recognised by the UCH, then the system remains locked.

The UCH controls the vehicle interior lighting. If a courtesy light is left on, the UCH will cut the lighting supply after  a period of approximately  30 minutes .\nNote: Unlocking can be performed by the UCH, if the airbag computer has detected an impact or if it is faulty (see  88C,  Airbag - Seat belt pretensioners ).\nThe \"top of the range\" version gradually dims the interior lights after one of the vehicle doors has been opened. After  the doors have been closed using the radiofrequency remote control, the interior lights are switched off immediately.\nReplacement keys are assigned to the vehicle VIN when they are ordered from the spare parts department. It is possible in the event of a key being stolen or lost or at the customer's request, for a vehicle key to be de- allocated. It can be reassigned to the same vehicle if necessary.\n82D-11 V1 MR-453-X79-82D000$040.mif\nFault finding – Function 82D\nThe UCH controls the command and supply part of the start-up function and the starting and charging process is  controlled by the UCH. For this function to operate normally, the protection function must have been successfully  completed.\nIMPORTANT: When the vehicle battery has a low charge, the drop in voltage caused by operating the starter could reactivate  the immobiliser. If the voltage is too low, the engine cannot be started, even by pushing the vehicle.\nNote: If several, i.e. three or four, attempts have been made using a key not allocated to the vehicle, the injection  computer locks. Insert a key allocated to the vehicle for  20 seconds  in  + after ignition feed , then switch off  the ignition and wait for the end of power-latch ( 20 minutes ) to allow the injection computer to unlock.\n* Powerlatch: Injection computer power supply duration after + 12V after ignition cut-off to the ignition switch.\n82D-12 V1 MR-453-X79-82D000$040.mif\nFault finding – Configuration\nNew parts are not coded.

It is impossible to erase the code or  program in another one. The programmed code cannot be erased .\nWARNING: The keys submitted during this procedure will only work if: they have already been coded on this vehicle, or they are new (not coded).\nNote: If only the UCH is replaced, there is no operation to perform on the injection computer, as it retains the same  immobiliser code.\n82D-13 V1 MR-453-X79-82D000$050.mif\nFault finding – Configuration 82D\nAccess and Safety function configurations in the UCH\nConfiguration readings available using the  diagnostic tool :\nConfiguration  reading Name of configuration Option Configuration\nLC012 Automatic relocking WITH  OR  WITHOUT\nLC097 Type of key ONE BUTTON  or  TWO BUTTONS\nLC113 Airbag WITH  OR  WITHOUT\nLC149 Key locking WITH  OR  WITHOUT\nLC165 Seat belt not fastened sensor ACTIVE  or  INACTIVE\nLC169 Vehicle locked by RAID* function YES  or  NO\nLC170 RAID* function authorisation by  diag tool WITH  OR  WITHOUT\nLC171 Radiofrequency function WITH  OR  WITHOUT\nLC172 Type of central door locking button  (CPE)* 1 POSITION  or  2  POSITIONS\n* RAID: Renault Anti-Intruder Device. * CPE: Electric central door locking.\n• Check the configurations in the  Read configurations  menu\n82D-14 V1 MR-453-X79-82D000$050.mif\nFault finding – Programming",

    "page_content": "Fault finding – Introduction 83A\nFAULT FINDING PROCEDURE (continued)\nFault finding problems\nDisconnecting the connectors and/or manipulating the wiring may temporarily remove the cause of a fault. Electrical measurements of voltage, resistance and insulation are generally correct, especially if the fault is not  present when the analysis is made (stored fault).\nLook for damage under the bonnet and in the passenger compartment. Carefully check the fuses, insulators and wiring harness routing. Look for signs of oxidation.\nWhile manipulating the wiring, use the diagnostic tool to note any change in fault status from stored to present. Make sure that the connectors are properly locked. Apply light pressure to the connectors. Twist the wiring harness. If there is a change in status, try to locate the source of the fault.\nInspection of each component\nDisconnect the connectors and check the appearance of the clips and tabs, as well as their crimping (no crimping on  the insulating section). Make sure that the clips and tabs are properly locked in the sockets. Check that no clips or tabs have been dislodged during connection. Check the clip contact pressure using an appropriate model of tab.\nCheck the continuity of entire lines, then section by section. Look for a short circuit to earth, to  + 12 V  or with another wire. If a fault is detected, repair or replace the wiring harness.\nAFTER REPAIR Check for correct operation.\nV1 MR-453-X79-83A000$010.mif",

Never power the test points with  12 V .\n85A-2 V1 MR-453-X79-85A000$010.mif\nFault finding – Introduction 85A\n3. SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS\nThe safety instructions must be followed at all times when working on components, to avoid damage or injury:  – check the battery voltage to avoid incorrect operation of computer functions, – use the proper tools.\nProcedure for disconnecting the battery: – switch off the ignition, – switch off all electrical consumers, – wait at least  1 minute  for the electronic systems to switch off, – disconnect the battery, starting with the negative terminal.\nFaults are declared present or stored (depending on whether they appeared in a certain context and have  disappeared since, or whether they remain present but are not diagnosed within the current context).\nConsider the fault status,  present  or  stored  when the  diagnostic tool  is used after the + after ignition feed  (without operating the system components).\nFor a  present fault , apply the procedure described in the Interpretation of faults section. For a  stored fault , note the faults displayed and apply the Notes section.\nIf the fault is  confirmed  when the instructions are applied, the fault is present. Deal with the fault. If the fault is  not confirmed , check: – the electrical connections that correspond to the fault, – the connectors for this connection, – the resistance of the faulty component, – the condition of the wires. Refer to paragraphs 4.1 Checking wiring and 4.2 Checking connectors\n85A-3 V1 MR-453-X79-85A000$010.mif\nFault finding – Introduction 85A\nThe aim of the conformity check is to check data that does not produce a fault on the  diagnostic tool  when the data  is inconsistent. Therefore, this stage is used to:  – carry out fault finding on faults that do not have a fault display, and which may correspond to a customer complaint, – check that the system is operating correctly and that there is no risk of a fault recurring after repairs.\nThis section gives the fault finding procedures for statuses and parameters and the conditions for checking them.\nIf a status is not behaving normally or a parameter is outside the permitted tolerance values, consult the  corresponding fault finding page.\nCustomer complaints - Fault finding chart\nIf the test with the  diagnostic tool  is OK but the customer complaint is still present, the fault should be processed  by  customer complaints .\nA summary of the overall procedure to follow is provided on the following page in the form of a flow chart.\n85A-4 V1 MR-453-X79-85A000$010.mif\nFault finding – Introduction 85A\n4. FAULT FINDING PROCEDURE\nCheck the battery charge and condition\nPrint the system fault finding log  (available on CLIP)\nDialogue with  computer?\nDeal with present faults\nThe cause is  still present\nDeal with stored faults\nUse fault finding charts (ALPs)\nThe cause is  still present The cause is  still present\nFault  solved Fault  solved\nContact the Techline with the  completed fault finding log\n85A-5 V1 MR-453-X79-85A000$010.mif\nFault finding – Introduction 85A\n4. FAULT FINDING PROCEDURE (CONTINUED)\nFault finding problems Disconnecting the connectors and/or manipulating the wiring may temporarily remove the cause of a fault.\nVisual inspection Look for damage under the bonnet and in the passenger compartment. Carefully check the protectors, insulation, and routing of the wiring, as well as the mountings.\nPhysical inspection While manipulating the wiring, use either the  diagnostic tool  to detect a change in status from \"stored\" to \"present\",  or use the multimeter to view the status changes. Make sure that the connectors are properly locked. Apply light pressure to the connectors. Twist the wiring harness.\nChecking earth insulation This check is carried out by measuring the voltage (multimeter in voltmeter mode) between the suspect connection  and the  12 V  or  5 V . The correct measured value is  0 V .\nChecking insulation against + 12 V or + 5 V This check is carried out by measuring the voltage (multimeter in voltmeter mode) between the suspect  connection and the earth. In the first instance, the earth may be taken on the chassis. The correct measured  value should be  0 V\nContinuity check A continuity check is carried out by measuring the resistance (multimeter in ohmmeter mode), with the connectors  disconnected at both ends. The expected result is  1  ΩΩΩΩ  ± 1  ΩΩΩΩ  for every connection. The line must be fully checked,  and the intermediate connections are only included in the method if this saves time during the fault finding  procedure. The continuity check on the multiplex lines must be carried out on both wires. The measured value  should be  1  ΩΩΩΩ  ± 1  ΩΩΩΩ .\nChecking the supply This check may be carried out using a test light ( 21 W  or  5 W  depending on the maximum authorised load).\n85A-6 V1 MR-453-X79-85A000$010.mif\nFault finding – Introduction 85A\n4.2 Checking the connectors\nNote: Carry out each requested check visually.  Do not remove a connector if it is not required.\nNote: Repeated connections and disconnections alter the functionality of the connectors and increase the risk of poor  electrical contact. Limit the number of connections/disconnections as much as possible.\nNote: The check is carried out on the 2 parts of the connection. There may be two types of connection: – Connector/Connector. – Connector/Device.\nVisual inspection of the connection: – Check that the connector is connected correctly and that the male and female parts of the connection are  correctly coupled.\nVisual inspection of the area around the connection: – Check the condition of the mounting (pin, strap, adhesive tape, etc.) if the connectors are attached to the vehicle. – Check that there is no damage to the wiring trim (sheath, foam, adhesive tape, etc.) near the wiring. – Check that there is no damage to the electrical wires at the connector outputs, in particular on the insulating material  (wear, cuts, burns, etc.).\nDisconnect the connector to continue the checks.\nVisual inspection of the plastic casing: – Check that there is no mechanical damage (casing crushed, split, broken, etc.), in particular to the fragile  components (lever, lock, sockets, etc.). – Check that there is no heat damage (casing melted, darker, deformed, etc.). – Check that there are no stains (grease, mud, liquid, etc.).\nVisual inspection of the metal contacts: (The female contact is called CLIP. The male contact is called TAB). – Check that there are no bent contacts (the contact is not inserted correctly and can come out of the back of the  connector). The contact comes out of the connector when the wire is pulled gently. – Check that there is no damage (folded tabs, clips open too wide, blackened or melted contact, etc.). – Check that there is no oxidation on the metal contacts.\n85A-7 V1 MR-453-X79-85A000$010.mif\nFault finding – Introduction 85A\nVisual inspection of the sealing: (Only for watertight connectors) – Check for the seal on the connection (between the 2 parts of the connection). – Check the seal at the back of the connectors: –  For  unit   joints (1 for each wire), check that the unit joints are present on each electrical wire and that they  are correctly positioned in the opening (level with the housing). Check that plugs are present on  openings which are not used. –  For a   grommet  seal (one seal which covers the entire internal surface of the connector), check that the seal  is present. –  For  gel  seals, check for gel in all of the sockets without removing the excess or any protruding sections (it does not  matter if there is gel on the contacts). –  For  hotmelt  sealing (heat-shrink sheath with glue), check that the sheath has contracted correctly on the rear of  the connectors and the electrical wires, and that the hardened glue comes out of the side of the wire. – Check that there is no damage to any of the seals (cuts, burns, significant deformation, etc.).\nIf a fault is detected, consult  Technical Note 6015A, Repairing electrical wiring .\n85A-8 V1 MR-453-X79-85A000$010.mif\nFault finding – Introduction 85A\nIMPORTANT Any fault on a complex system requires thorough fault finding with the appropriate tools.  The FAULT FINDING LOG, which should be completed during the fault finding procedure,  ensures a record is kept of the procedure carried out. It is an essential document when  consulting the manufacturer.\nIT IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL THAT THE FAULT FINDING LOG IS FILLED OUT EVERY TIME IT IS  REQUESTED BY TECHLINE OR THE WARRANTY RETURNS DEPARTMENT.\nYou will always be asked for this log: – when requesting technical assistance from Techline, – for approval requests when replacing parts for which approval is mandatory, – to be attached to monitored parts for which reimbursement is requested. The log is needed for warranty  reimbursement, and enables better analysis of the parts removed.\n6. SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS\nSafety rules must be observed during any work on a component to prevent any material damage or personal injury: – check the battery voltage to avoid incorrect operation of computer functions, – use the proper tools.\n85A-9 V1 MR-453-X79-85A000$010.mif\nFault finding – List and location of components\n1 UCH 5 Rear screen wiper motor\n2 Passenger compartment fuse box 6 Washer pump\n3 Combined wiper-washer 7  Heated rear screen\n4 Windscreen wiper motor\n85A-10 V1 MR-453-X79-85A000$020.mif\nFault finding – Role of components\nScreen wiper motor: The role of the windscreen wiper motor is to provide windscreen cleaning.\nRear screen wiper motor:  The role of the rear screen wiper motor is to provide rear screen cleaning.\nCombined wiper-washer: The role of the combined wiper-washer control is to control the various washing and wiping functions.\nScreen washer pump: – Without rear screen wiping: The role of the screen washer pump is to supply washer fluid to the windscreen. – With rear screen wiping: The role of the bi-directional screen washer pump is to supply washer fluid from the same reservoir to either  the windscreen or the rear screen.\nHeated rear screen: The role of the heated rear screen is to defrost the rear screen.\nUCH:  The UCH is used to manage all wiper functions (activation, wiper speed, etc).\n85A-11 V1 MR-453-X79-85A000$030.mif\nFault finding – Function\nWindscreen washing/wiping\nThe UCH receives the intermittent wiper speed and the windscreen wiper park information. This provides the following functions: – intermittent wiper speed, – extended wiper time after washing, – return to park position. In the park position, the switch is closed to  earth , and the UCH receives logical information  0 .\nThis function is only active if  + after ignition feed  is present. When the  + after ignition feed  is switched on, if the windscreen wiper park position is not detected, the wiper  motor relay is held.\nOperation is interrupted in the following cases: – wiper request stopped or no request, –  + after ignition  switched off, – UCH reads park information.\nDetection of the park position should be made on transition and not level, that is, if the wiper stalk is moved from the  intermittent position to the park position while the wiper blade is in the park position and the wiper motor is running,  it will not be stopped until the next reading of the park position. This condition is necessary in order to obtain an exact  park position.\nIntermittent  The intermittent wiper speed function is only active if the  + after ignition  is present and if the switch is in the  intermittent position. The time delay between two wipes is  5 seconds , and this cannot be modified by the  diagnostic tool .\nWhen the windscreen intermittent speed function is activated, the windscreen intermittent speed relay is held by the  UCH until the park position is detected. When the intermittent speed time delay has elapsed, the relay is held again  and the cycle begins again.\n85A-12 V1 MR-453-X79-85A000$040.mif\nFault finding – Function 85A\nRear screen washing/wiping\nThe UCH does not control the rear screen wiper, this function is managed by a direct command.\nHeated rear screen time delay\nThis output controls a diode relay external to the UCH, delivering the power to supply the heated rear screen.\nThe de-icing time delay is activated by pressing the heated rear screen button located on the central console panel.\nThe heated rear screen time delay is deactivated: – by pressing the button again if the time delay between activation and deactivation is less than  50 seconds , – automatically if the time delay has elapsed, – directly if there is a cut in the  + after ignition  or engine speed signal.\nThe minimum time delay between two presses of the button so that the command is taken into account, should not  be less than  200 ms .\n85A-13 V1 MR-453-X79-85A000$040.mif\nFault finding – Configuration\nConfigurations of the wiper function in the UCH\nIndividual configuration available on  diagnostic tool , with the associated configuration reading:\nConfiguration reading LC116\nName of configuration Intermittent variation according to speed\nOption WITH or WITHOUT\nConfiguration SC008 UCH type\n85A-14 V1 MR-453-X79-85A000$050.mif\nFault finding – Interpretation of faults",

Deal with the fault.\nIf the fault is  not confirmed , check: – the electrical lines which correspond to the fault, – the connectors on these lines (corrosion, bent pins, etc.), – the  resistance  of the faulty component, – the condition of the wires (melted or cut insulation, wear).\nThe conformity check is designed to check the statuses and parameters that do not display any faults on the  diagnostic tool  when they are inconsistent. Therefore, this stage is used to:\n– carry out fault finding on faults that do not have a fault display, and which may correspond to a customer complaint, – check that the system is operating correctly and that there is no risk of a fault recurring after repair.\nThis section gives the fault finding procedures for statuses and parameters and the conditions for checking them.\nIf a status is not behaving normally or a parameter is outside permitted tolerance values, you should consult the  corresponding fault finding page.\nCustomer complaints - Fault finding chart\nIf the test with the  diagnostic tool  is OK but the customer complaint is still present, the fault should be dealt with by  customer complaints .\nA summary of the overall procedure to follow is provided on the following page in the form of a flow chart.\n87B-3 V1 MR-453-X79-87B000$010.mif",

    "page_content": "Fault finding – Introduction 87B\n4. FAULT FINDING PROCEDURE (CONTINUED)\nNote: Carry out each requested check visually. Do not remove a connector if it is not required.\nNote: Repeated connections and disconnections alter the functionality of the connectors and increase the risk of poor  electrical contact. Limit the number of connections/disconnections as much as possible.\nNote: The check is carried out on the 2 parts of the connection. There may be two types of connection: – Connector / Connector – Connector / Device\nFault finding problems Disconnecting the connectors and/or manipulating the wiring may temporarily clear the cause of a fault. Electrical measurements of voltage, resistance and insulation are generally correct, especially if the fault is not  present when the analysis is made (stored fault).\nVisual inspection of the connection: • Check that the connector is connected correctly and that the male and female parts of the connection are correctly  coupled.\nVisual inspection of the area around the connection: • Check the condition of the mounting (pin, strap, adhesive tape, etc.) if the connectors are attached to the vehicle. • Check that there is no damage to the wiring trim (sheath, foam, adhesive tape, etc.) near the wiring. • Check that there is no damage to the electrical wires at the connector outputs, in particular on the insulating material  (wear, cuts, burns, etc.).\nDisconnect the connector to continue the checks.\nVisual inspection of the plastic casing: • Check that there is no mechanical damage (casing crushed, cracked, broken, etc.), in particular to the fragile  components (lever, lock, openings, etc.). • Check that there is no heat damage (casing melted, darker, deformed, etc.). • Check that there are no stains (grease, mud, liquid, etc.).\nVisual inspection of the metal contacts: (The female  contact  is called CLIP. The male contact is called TAB). • Check that there are no bent contacts (the contact is not inserted correctly and can come out of the back of the  connector). The spring contact of the connector when the wire is gently pulled. • Check that there is no damage (folded tabs, clips open too wide, blackened or melted contact, etc.). • Check that there is no oxidation on the metal contacts.\n87B-5 V1 MR-453-X79-87B000$010.mif",

Check that plugs are present on openings which are  not used. – For a  grommet  seal (one seal which covers the entire internal surface of the connector), check that the seal is  present. – For  gel  seals, check for gel in all of the openings without removing the excess or any protruding sections  (it does not matter if there is gel on the contacts). – For  hotmelt  sealing (heat-shrink sheath with glue), check that the sheath has contracted correctly on the rear of  the connectors and electrical wires, and that the hardened glue comes out of the side of the wire. • Check that there is no damage to any of the seals (cuts, burns, significant deformation, etc.).\nIf a fault is detected, repair or replace the wiring (see  Technical Note 6015A, Electrical wiring repair, Wiring:  Precautions for repair ).\nIMPORTANT All faults involving a complex system call for thorough diagnostics with the appropriate tools.  The FAULT FINDING LOG, which should be completed during the fault finding procedure,  ensures a record is kept of the procedure carried out. It is an essential document when  consulting the manufacturer.\nIT IS THEREFORE MANDATORY TO FILL IN A FAULT FINDING LOG EACH TIME IT IS REQUESTED BY  TECHLINE OR THE WARRANTY RETURNS DEPARTMENT.\nYou will always be asked for this log: – when requesting technical assistance from the Techline, – when requesting approval before replacing parts for which approval is compulsory, – to be attached to monitored parts for which reimbursement is requested. The log is needed for – warranty reimbursement, and enables better analysis of the parts removed.\n6. SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS\nThe safety instructions must be followed at all times when working on components in order to avoid damage or injury:\n– check the battery voltage to avoid incorrect operation of computer functions, – use the appropriate tools\n87B-6 V1 MR-453-X79-87B000$010.mif\nPASSENGER COMPARTMENT CONNECTION UNIT Fault finding – List and location of components\n2 Passenger Compartment Fuse and  Relay Box\n6 Rear right-hand door rabbet switch\n7  Rear left-hand door rabbet switch\n8 Driver's door rabbet switch\n9 Passenger's door rabbet switch\n10 Luggage compartment switch\n11 Heated rear screen\n12 Heated rear screen switch\n13 Airbag computer / pretensioner\n87B-7 V1 MR-453-X79-87B000$020.mif",

These two wires are called multiplex line H and multiplex line L.\nOn this vehicle, there is only one multiplex network. Depending on the vehicle options, it can include the following  computers: ABS, ESP, torque distributor – ETC, injection, and DP0.\nData is exchanged by the computers on the  multiplex  network at a communication speed of 500 kbit/s.\nIn contrast to standard  multiplex  networks that have two  120   Ω   resistors at the two network terminations, this  network has just one  60  ΩΩΩΩ  resistor.   This  60   Ω   line resistor is located in the injection computer .\n– The purpose of the multiplex network test is to determine the various computers present on the vehicle's multiplex  network as well as the cause of possible inter-computer communication faults.\n– It also serves to determine the functions installed in the vehicle which are often housed in various computers  (distributed functions, e.g.: Air conditioning, Security access, etc.).\n– The multiplex network test can also run fault finding on computers disconnected from the multiplex network;  this provides an overview of the vehicle's electronic layout.\n88B-2 V1 MR-453-X79-88B000$010.mif\nFault finding – Introduction 88B",

SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS\nAll operations on the airbag system must be carried out by qualified trained personnel.\nSafety rules must be observed during any work on a component to prevent any damage or injury: – check the battery voltage to avoid incorrect operation of computer functions, – use the appropriate tools, – During any operation on the airbag system, it is essential to use the computer locking command to avoid any risk  of accidental triggering (all the trigger lines will be inhibited).\nWARNING: During any operation on the airbag systems, it is essential to use the computer locking command to avoid any risk of accidental triggering (all the trigger lines will be inhibited). The locked mode is indicated when the instrument panel warning light comes on.\nNote: If the operation is being performed following an impact that triggered the airbags, the computer cannot be locked until the unlocking command has been given. After animpact that triggeredtheairbags,thefaults stored inthecomputer cannot be cleareduntil the \"Read impact  context\" command has been given, followed by the unlocking command.\nNever measure the airbag trigger lines using any tool other than the  XRBAG  or the airbag wiring check function on  the  CLIP  and  NXR  tools.\nBefore using a dummy ignition module, check that its resistance is between:  1.8  ΩΩΩΩ  and  2.5  ΩΩΩΩ .\nDuring the procedure,  make sure the computer voltage does not drop below 10 V .\n88C-3 V1 MR-453-X79-88C000$010.mif",

Inhibition of passenger trigger lines:\nThis function is managed by the airbag computer, according to the position of the passenger airbag inhibition switch  and taking into account the vehicle context. The change of status of the inhibition switch responds to transverse programming (manufacturer's industry  regulation) that authorises taking it into account  10 seconds  after the vehicle ignition is switched on  (computer supply).\nInhibition programming: – trigger lines inhibited and  Airbag Off  warning light illuminated if switch is  OFF (100   Ω ), – trigger lines authorised if the switch is  ON  ( 400   Ω ), – trigger lines inhibited,  Airbag Fault  and  Airbag Off  warning lights illuminated if a fault is detected, if the switch is  not configured and detected as present, or if there is a change of position not fulfilling the conditions.\nBy default, when the key is in the inhibition position, the following protections and signals are inhibited in the event of  a crash: – front passenger front airbag. – front passenger chest airbag. – SBR* warnings: the inhibition key causes the inhibition of the warning light and buzzer, and deactivates the radio  cut-off warning for the occupant.\nThis remains configurable by the diagnostic procedure except for the SBR* warnings.\nThe passenger front airbag and passenger chest airbag are inhibited when the locking switch is positioned on  OFF   or when  DF028   PASSENGER AIRBAG STATUS INDICATOR LIGHT CIRCUIT  or  DF193   PASSENGER AIRBAG  LOCKING STATUS CHANGE  is present in the computer memory.\n4. Seat belt locking monitoring:\nThis function is managed by the computer (warning light and audible signal): – driver's seat belt buckled (contact open), – driver's seat belt not buckled (contact closed).\n5. Management and monitoring of the airbag warning lights:\nThe airbag computer controls and checks the status of the  Airbag fault  and  Airbag Off  warning lights on the  instrument panel. These signals are exchanged via wire.\nThe  Airbag fault  warning light illuminates for  4 seconds  when the ignition is switched on ( + after ignition ), the time  necessary for the system to be operational after the vehicle is started. It then remains off except under the following  conditions: – detection and recording of an airbag system fault (input - output fault, configuration fault), – a crash has been detected and registered, – if the computer is  crash locked  by a  diagnostic tool , – if the computer must be programmed or reprogrammed.\nThe  Airbag Off  warning light represents the actual inhibition status of the passenger airbags: –  off  = active (switch  ON) , –  illuminated  = passenger airbags inactive (switch  OFF  or detection of a fault on the switch line).\nThe 2 warning lights can be illuminated simultaneously.\nSBR*: Seat Belt Reminder\n88C-16 V1 MR-453-X79-88C000$050.mif",
