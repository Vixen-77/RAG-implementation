They then  deflate immediately so that the passen- gers are not in any way hindered when  leaving the vehicle.\nThe airbag system uses py- rotechnic principles. This  explains why, when the  airbag inflates, it will gener- ate heat, produce smoke (this does  not mean that a fire is about to start)  and make a banging noise. In a situ- ation where an airbag  is required, it  will inflate immediately and this may  cause some minor, superficial graz- ing to the skin or other problems.\nENG_UD47300_1 Dispositifs complémentaires aux ceintures avant (HJD - Dacia) ENG_NU_1271-2_HJD_Dacia_1\nMETHODS OF RESTRAINT IN ADDITION TO THE FRONT SEAT BELTS  (3/3)\nAll of the warnings below are given so that the  airbag  is not obstructed in any way when it is inflated and also to prevent  the risk of serious injuries caused by items which may be dislodged when it inflates.\nWarnings concerning the driver’s  airbag – Do not modify the steering wheel or the steering wheel boss. – Do not cover the steering wheel boss under any circumstances. – Do not attach any objects (badge, logo, clock, telephone holder, etc.) to the steering wheel boss. – You must not remove the steering wheel (such work must only be performed by trained personnel from our Network). – Do not sit too close to the steering wheel when driving: sit with your arms slightly bent (see “Adjusting your driving position”  in Section 1). This will allow sufficient space for the airbag to deploy correctly and be fully effective.\nWarnings concerning the passenger  airbag – Do not attach or glue any objects (badge, logo, clock, telephone holder, etc.) to the dashboard on or near the airbag. – Do not place anything between the dashboard and the passenger (pet, umbrella, walking stick, parcels, etc.). – The passenger must not put his or her feet on the dashboard or seat as there is a risk that serious injuries may occur. In  general, all parts of the body should be kept away from the dashboard (knees, hands, head etc.). – Reactivate the passenger airbag as soon as you remove the child seat to ensure the protection of the front passenger in the  event of an impact.\nA REAR-FACING CHILD SEAT MUST NOT BE FITTED TO THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT UNLESS  THE RESTRAINT SYSTEMS IN ADDITION TO THE SEAT BELT, I.E.

Children  are at risk of specific injuries as their  muscles and bones have not yet fin- ished growing. The seat belt alone  would not provide suitable protection.  Use an approved child seat and ensure  you use it correctly.\nNever leave an animal,  child or adult who is not self-suffi- cient alone on your vehicle, even for  a short time.\nThey may pose a risk to themselves  or to others by starting the engine,  activating equipment such as the  electric windows or by locking the  doors.\nAlso, in hot and/or sunny weather,  please remember that the tempera- ture inside the passenger compart- ment increases very quickly.\nRISK OF DEATH OR SERIOUS  INJURY.\nA collision at 30 mph  (50 km/h) is the same as fall- ing a distance of 10 metres.  Transporting a child without  a restraint is the equivalent of allow- ing him or her to play on a fourth- floor balcony without railings. Never travel with a child held in your  arms. In the event of an accident,  you will not be able to keep hold of  the child, even if you yourself are  wearing a seat belt. If your vehicle has been involved in  a road accident, replace the child  seat and have the seat belts and  ISOFIX anchorage points checked.\nTo prevent the doors being  opened, use the childproof  locks (refer to the informa- tion on “Locking/unlocking  the opening elements” in Section 1).\nENG_UD52164_2 Sécurite enfants : généralités (HJD - Dacia) ENG_NU_1271-2_HJD_Dacia_1\nCHILD SAFETY: General information  (2/2)\nThe level of protection offered by the  child seat depends on its ability to re- strain your child and on its installation.  Incorrect installation compromises the  protection it offers the child in the event  of harsh braking or an impact.\nSet a good example by always fas- tening your seat belt and teaching  your child: – to strap themselves in correctly; – to always get in and out of the car  at the kerb, away from busy traf- fic.\nBefore purchasing a child seat, check  that it complies with the regulations for  the country you are in and that it can  be fitted in your vehicle. Consult an ap- proved dealer to find out which seats  are recommended for your vehicle.\nDo not use a second-hand child  seat or one without an instruction  manual. Check that there are no objects in  the vicinity of the child seat which  could impede its operation.\nNever leave a child unat- tended in the vehicle.\nBefore fitting a child seat, read the  manual and respect its instructions. If  you experience any difficulties during  installation, contact the manufacturer  of the equipment. Keep the instructions  with the seat.\nCheck that your child is  always strapped in and that  the belt or safety harness used is  correctly set and adjusted. Avoid  wearing bulky clothing which could  cause the belts to slacken.\nNever let your child put their head or  arms out of the window.\nCheck that the child is in the correct  position for the entire journey, espe- cially if asleep.\nENG_UD52164_2 Sécurite enfants : généralités (HJD - Dacia) ENG_NU_1271-2_HJD_Dacia_1\nCHILD SAFETY: choosing a child seat",

This gives it a  higher centre of gravity, making it  more susceptible to overturning in  the event of sudden or aggressive  manoeuvres or when cornering  sharply at high speeds. Take extra care when the vehicle is  loaded (in particular when the load  is on the roof). Ensure that all passengers are  wearing their seat belts.\nENG_UD47328_1 Conseils de conduite, eco conduite (HJD - Dacia) ENG_NU_1271-2_HJD_Dacia_2\nDRIVING ADVICE, ECO-DRIVING  (5/5)\n–  In vehicles fitted with air condi- tioning,  it is normal to observe an  increase in fuel consumption (es- pecially in urban conditions) when  it is used. For vehicles fitted with  manual air conditioning, switch off  the system when it is not required.\nAdvice for reducing consumption  and therefore helping   to   preserve  the environment:\nIf the vehicle has been parked in the  sun, open the doors for a few mo- ments to let the hot air escape before  starting the engine. – Do not leave an empty roof rack  fitted to the vehicle. – It is better to fit a trailer for bulky ob- jects. – When towing a caravan, fit a wind  deflector and adjust it carefully. – Avoid using the car for door-to-door  calls (short journeys with long waits  in between) because the engine  never reaches its normal operating  temperature.\n– Favour the ECO mode. – Electricity is fuel; switch off all the  electrical components which are  not really needed.  However  (safety  first), keep your lights on when the  visibility is bad (“see and be seen”). – Use the air vents. Driving with the  windows open at 60 mph (100 km/h)  will increase fuel consumption by  4%. – Never fill the fuel tank right to the  brim to avoid overflow.\nENG_UD47328_1 Conseils de conduite, eco conduite (HJD - Dacia) ENG_NU_1271-2_HJD_Dacia_2",

In this  case, the wheels may lock intermit- tently to achieve better grip, thus reduc- ing braking distances on soft ground.  When this mode is active: – the vehicle’s manoeuvrability is lim- ited during braking.

In addition, this system  can increase stopping distances, par- ticularly on roads with low surface grip  (wet ground etc.).\nYou will feel a pulsation through the  brake pedal each time the system is  activated. The ABS does not in any way  improve the vehicle's physical perform- ance relating to the road surface and  roadholding. It is still  essential  to follow  the rules of good driving practice (such  as driving at a safe distance from the  vehicle in front etc.).\nThese functions are an ad- ditional aid in the event of  critical driving conditions,  enabling the vehicle behav- iour to be adapted to suit the driv- ing conditions. The functions do not  take the place of the driver.  They do  not increase the vehicle’s limits  and should not encourage you  to drive more quickly.  Therefore,  they can under no circumstances  replace the vigilance or responsibil- ity of the driver when manoeuvring  the vehicle (the driver must always  be ready for sudden incidents which  may occur when driving).\nIn an emergency, apply  firm and  continuous pressure  to the brake  pedal.

These are more sensitive  to imbalance. If you experience vi- bration while driving, contact an ap- proved dealer.\nENG_UD52045_2 Pneumatiques (HJD - Dacia) ENG_NU_1271-2_HJD_Dacia_5",

Reminder: only products approved  by our Technical Department may be used for this purpose.\nENG_UD50107_1 Anomalies de fonctionnement (HJD - Dacia) ENG_NU_1271-2_HJD_Dacia_5",

Contact an authorised dealer for any towing equipment modifications. – For vehicles fitted with a trailer,  the gross train weight (vehicle + trailer) must never be exceeded . However, the following  is tolerated: – the Maximum permissible weight at the rear may be exceeded by no more than 15%, – the maximum permissible all-up weight may be exceeded by no more than 10% or 100 kg (whichever occurs first).   In either case, the maximum speed of the vehicle and trailer must not exceed 50 mph (80 km/h) and the tyre pressure must be  increased by 0.2 bar (3 psi). – The engine output and climbing capability are reduced with altitude. We recommend that the maximum load be reduced by  10% at an altitude of 1,000 metres and by an additional 10% for each 1,000 metres thereafter.

If the tappet piston de- presses, immerse the tappets in a container full of diesel then reprime them.\nFailure to follow this advice could lead to the blocking of the oil inlet holes, which would quickly result in engine damage.\na  Place the camshaft in a vice with  aluminium jaws .\nTOP AND FRONT OF ENGINE Camshaft: Removal - Refitting\n- the air filter unit (see  12A ,  Fuel mixture ,  Air filter unit: Removal - Refitting , page  12A-6 ) ,\n- the timing belt (see  11A ,  Top and front of engine , Timing belt: Removal - Refitting , page  11A-17 ) ,\n- the air resonator (see  12A ,  Fuel mixture ,  Air res- onator: Removal - Refitting , page  12A-2 ) ,\n- the right-hand suspended engine mounting (see 19D ,  Engine mounting ,  Right-hand suspended engine mounting: Removal - Refitting , page 19D-4 ) ,\n- the accessories belt (see  11A ,  Top and front of engine ,  Accessories belt: Removal - Refitting , page  11A-2 ) ,\n- the front right-hand wheel (see  Wheel: Removal - Refitting ) (35A, Wheels and tyres).\na  Connect the battery (see  Battery: Removal - Refit- ting ) (80A, Battery).\na  Refit the new camshaft dowel (precoated section ( 7 ) on the camshaft side).\na  Torque tighten  the camshaft dowel (8 N.m)  using a roller-type stud removal tool  ( 6 ) .",

    "page_content": "Our braking technology, and in particular the disc brakes (hollow pistons which conduct little heat, have a low volume of fluid in the cylinder, sliding callipers avoiding the need for a fluid reserve in the least cooled area of the wheel), has allowed us to prevent the risk of « vapour lock » as far as possible, even with heavy braking (mountainous area). However, current brake fluids are subject to minor deterioration during the first months of use due to slight humidity intake. This is why it is recommended that you change the brake fluid: see maintenance booklet for the vehicle .\n1 - Topping up the level\nWear of the brake pads will result in a gradual drop in the fluid level in the reservoir.\nDo not top up the fluid, as the level will rise again when the pads are next changed. The brake fluid level must not fall below the minimum mark.\n2 - Approved brake fluid\nMixing two incompatible brake fluids in the brake circuit  may lead to:\n- serious risk of leakage due mainly to deterioration of the cups,\n- deterioration in the operation of the ESP system.\nTo prevent such risks, it is essential to use only brake fluids that comply with the RENAULT standard (see Vehicle: Parts and consumables for the repair ) .\nGENERAL INFORMATION Brake: Specifications 30A\nDisc diameter 280 269\nMinimum disc thickness (1) 21.8 19.8\nMaximum disc run-out 0.07\nBrake lining thickness (including backplate) 17.8 17.4\nMinimum brake lining thickness (including backplate) 7.5 8.1\nMaximum drum wear diameter 229.5\nThickness of primary brake lining 4.9\nThickness of secondary brake lining 4.9\n(1) Brake discs cannot be reground.

Ensure any brake fluid spilt on parts of the vehicle is cleaned off.\nIn case of incorrect handling, the brake fluid can cause serious injury and damage. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for brake fluid.\nTo ensure that the wheel speed sensor works prop- erly, do not mark the sensor target on the bearing.\nWhen removing a hub, it is essential to replace the bearing with a new one.\n1 - Advice to be followed before any operation\nProtect any bodywork components that risk being dam- aged by brake fluid with a cover.\n2 - Instructions to be followed during the operation\nDo not press the bearing's internal bush so as to avoid damaging the bearing (very high shrink-ﬁtting force).\nClean around the braking system with  BRAKE CLEANER   (see  Vehicle: Parts and consumables for the repair ) (04B, Consumables - Products).\nIt is essential to check the condition of the hub and bearing surface and the hub carrier bore before refit- ting the bearing.\nPrepare for the ﬂow of ﬂuid, and protect the sur- rounding components.\nUse  SURFACE CLEANER   (see  Vehicle: Parts and  consumables for the repair ) (04B, Consumables -  Products) to clean:\n- the new bearing's internal and external surfaces which are in contact with the hub carrier and the hub,\nDo not allow friction materials to come into contact with grease, oil or other lubricants and cleaning products which are mineral oil based.\n- the hub carrier surfaces in contact with the new bear- ing,\n- the hub surfaces in contact with the new bearing.\nAlways check the surface condition of the hub carrier before refitting the \"hub - bearing\" assembly.\nClean the surfaces of the hub carrier that are in contact with the \"hub - bearing\" assembly using  SURFACE CLEANER   (see  Vehicle: Parts and consumables for the repair ) (04B, Consumables - Products)\nReplace any component whose contact surfaces have deep scratches or cracks.\nFRONT AXLE COMPONENTS Front axle components: Precautions for the repair 31A\n2 - Suspension spring\nWhen replacing the spring, ensure that the positioning and orientation of the spring and the tool cups are cor- rect.\nTo prevent any damage, do not use the lower arm as support for the lifting system.\nWhen replacing a spring, always replace the spring on the opposite side.\nIf a shock absorber is replaced, the shock absorber on the opposite side must also be replaced.\nCheck the condition of all the gaiters before refitting. Always replace any damaged components with new ones.\nCheck that the spring compressor tool is operating cor- rectly.\nIn the interests of safety, do not leave a spring com- pressed in the spring compressor tool.\nDuring assembly and removing operations, the surface and the protection paint must not be damaged.\nThere must be no impacts during operations. Any han- dling hooks and tightening or positioning clamps should be equipped with rubber or plastic in order to avoid damage on the springs.\nIt is recommended to replace springs if:\n- the paint is damaged,\n- the spring has dents in it.\nThey are not usually symmetrical in shape and care should be taken to assemble them the right way round. This can be done using the coloured marking's posi- tion.\nTo prevent the suspension spring from prematurely breaking, do not damage the anti-corrosion protec- tion.\nDuring assembly and removing operations, the surface and the protection paint must not be damaged.\nThere must be no impacts during operations.

To avoid damaging the bonnet, only reﬁt a battery which is identical to the battery originally ﬁtted.\nIncorrect tightening could cause heating of con- tacts, starting or charging faults, sparking, or could cause the battery to explode.\nWhen a battery is charging, oxygen and hydrogen are produced. The mixture of these two gases is explosive.\nThe smallest of sparks or heat sources can cause an explosion. The explosion is so strong that the battery can shatter and spray the acid into the surrounding at- mosphere.\nPeople nearby are at risk (exploded fragments, acid splashes). Acid splashes are dangerous. They also damage clothing.\nSafeguarding against the danger of explosion, which can be caused by handling a battery carelessly, must be taken very seriously.\nBATTERY Battery: Removal - Refitting 80A",

FAULT FINDING PROCEDURE (continued)\nFault finding problems Disconnecting the connectors and/or manipulating the wiring may temporarily clear the cause of a fault. Electrical measurements of voltage, resistance and insulation are generally correct, especially if the fault is not  present when the analysis is made (stored fault).\nVisual inspection Look for damage under the bonnet and in the passenger compartment. Carefully check the fuses, insulators and wiring harness routing. Look for signs of oxidation.\nTactile inspection When handling the wiring, use the  diagnostic tool  to detect any change in fault statuses from \"stored\" to \"present\". Make sure that the connectors are firmly secured. Apply light pressure to the connectors. Twist the wiring harness. If there is a change in status, try to locate the source of the fault.\nInspection of each component Disconnect the connectors and check the appearance of the clips and tabs, as well as the crimping (no crimping on  the insulating section). Make sure that the clips and tabs are properly locked in the sockets. Check that the clips or tabs have not been bent back during connection. Check the clip contact pressure using an appropriate model of tab.\nResistance check Check the continuity of the complete lines, then section by section. Look for a short circuit to earth, to  + 12 V  or with another wire.\nIf a fault is detected, repair or replace the wiring harness.\n13B-5 V1 MR-453-X79-13B000$010.mif\nDCM 1.2 injection Program No.: 4C Vdiag No.: 08\nFault finding – Introduction 13B\nIMPORTANT All faults involving a complex system call for thorough diagnostics with the appropriate tools. The  FAULT FINDING LOG, which should be completed during the fault finding procedure, ensures a  record is kept of the procedure carried out. It is an essential document when consulting the  manufacturer.\nIT IS THEREFORE MANDATORY TO FILL OUT A FAULT FINDING LOG EVERY TIME THE TECHLINE OR THE WARRANTY RETURN SERVICE ASKS FOR IT.\nYou will always be asked for this log: – when requesting technical assistance from the Techline, – when requesting approval before replacing parts for which approval is compulsory, – to be enclosed when returning monitored parts on request. The log is needed for warranty reimbursement, and  enables better analysis of the parts which have been removed.",

Plugs are  to be used only once. They must be discarded after use (once used they are soiled and cleaning is not sufficient to  make them reusable). Unused plugs must be thrown away.\nEnsure that you have hermetically resealable plastic bags for storing removed parts. Parts stored in this way will be  less susceptible to the risk of contamination. The bags are to be used once only, and discarded after use.\nUse lint-free cleaning cloths (cloth part reference  77 11 211 707 ). The use of ordinary cloth or paper is not permitted.  They are not lint-free and could contaminate the fuel circuit. A lint-free cloth should only be used once.\nUse fresh cleaning agent for each operation (used cleaning agent is contaminated). Pour it into a clean receptacle.\nFor each operation, use a clean brush in good condition (the brush must not shed its bristles).\nUse a brush and cleaning agent to clean the unions to be opened.\nBlow compressed air over the cleaned parts (tools, workbench, the parts, unions and injection system zones). Check  that no bristles are left.\nWash your hands before and during the operation if necessary.\nWhen wearing leather protective gloves cover them with latex gloves to prevent contamination.\n13B-8 V1 MR-453-X79-13B000$020.mif\nDCM 1.2 injection Program No.: 4C Vdiag No.: 08\nFault finding – Cleanliness guidelines 13B",

The ambient atmosphere carries contamination.\nAll components removed from the injection system must be stored in a hermetically-sealed plastic bag once  the plugs have been inserted.\nUsing a brush, cleaning agent, air gun, brush or normal cloth is strictly prohibited once the circuit has been opened.  These items could allow contamination to enter the system.\nA new component replacing an old one must not be removed from its packaging until it is to be fitted to the vehicle.\n13B-9 V1 MR-453-X79-13B000$020.mif\nDCM 1.2 injection Program No.: 4C Vdiag No.: 08\nFault finding – System operation\nThe  DCM1.2  injection system used on the  K9K  engine is an electronically managed high pressure injection system.  The fuel is compressed by a high pressure pump then stored in a rail that feeds the injectors. Injection takes place  when a current pulse is applied to the injector holders.\nThe injection flow is proportional to the rail pressure and to the applied pulse length, and the start of injection is  synchronised with the start of the pulse.\nThe system includes two subsystems, which have different fuel pressure levels: – the low pressure circuit contains the tank, the diesel fuel filter, the transfer pump and the injector holder return pipes, – the high pressure circuit contains the high pressure pump, the rail, the injector holders and the high pressure tubes.\nThe injection system contains a number of control sensors and actuators that enable the entire system to be  controlled and monitored.\nFunction: Fuel supply management (timing, flow and pressure).\nQuantity of fuel injected and injection timing setting The injection checking parameters are the quantities to be injected and their respective timing. These are calculated by the computer using signals from the following sensors: – Engine speed (crankshaft + cam lobe for synchronisation). – Accelerator pedal. – Turbocharging pressure and air temperature (Turbocharger pressure). – Coolant temperature. – Air temperature. – Air load (Flow and Pressure). – Rail pressure.\nThe quantities to be injected and their respective timing are converted into: – a reference tooth, – the time between this tooth and the start of activation, – the time for which the supply to the injector holder is on.\nEach injector holder is controlled by an electrical current which is sent according to previously calculated data. The  system makes one or two injections (one pilot injection, one main injection). The general principle is to calculate an overall injected flow, which is then divided into the main injection flow, and a  pilot injection flow to promote proper combustion and help reduce pollutant emissions.\n13B-10 V1 MR-453-X79-13B000$030.mif\nDCM 1.2 injection Program No.: 4C Vdiag No.: 08\nFault finding – System operation 13B\nAn accelerometer is used to monitor some of the fuel injection deviation. This has several roles: – Protecting the engine by detecting injection leaks (disabled on the basic version). – Checking the pilot quantity by measuring deviation and variation.\nThe quantity of fuel injected and the exact moment the mixture ignites can be readjusted by changing both the  injection duration and advance.\nRail pressure check The quality of combustion is influenced by the size of the atomised droplets in the cylinder.\nIn the combustion chamber, smaller fuel droplets will have time to burn fully, and will not produce smoke or unburned  particles. To meet the pollution requirements, the droplet size, and therefore the size of the injection holes must be  reduced.\nWith smaller holes, less fuel will be able to be introduced at a given pressure, which limits the power. To offset this  disadvantage, the quantity of fuel injected must be increased, which means increased pressure (and more holes in  the injector nozzles).  For the  DCM 1.2  injection system, the pressure reaches  1400 bar - 1600 bar  in the rail and must be constantly  regulated. The measuring circuit comprises an active pressure sensor on the rail connected to an analogue port on  the computer.\nThe high pressure pump is supplied at low pressure ( 5 bar ) by a built-in transfer pump. It supplies the rail, the  pressure of which is controlled by the fuel flow actuator ( IMV ) for filling, and by the injector valves for discharging.  This compensates for pressure drops. The fuel flow actuator enables the high pressure pump to only supply the  quantity of diesel fuel required to maintain the rail pressure. This mechanism minimises the heat generated and  improves engine output.\nIn order to discharge the rail using the injector valves, the valves are actuated by short electrical pulses which are: – short enough in amplitude not to open the injector (and pass through the return circuit from the injectors), – long enough in time to open the valves and discharge the rail.\nThe fuel surplus is sent back to the fuel filter or the tank, according to its flow. If there is no fuel flow actuator control,  the rail pressure is limited by a discharge valve fitted on the pump.\nNew pump chamber filling procedure (pump boosting) The pump lubrication goes through a booster cycle during which the pump is filled and pressurised before  \"transferring\" the diesel fuel to the rail.\nThis lubrication goes through programming called  \"new pump chamber filling\" , which prohibits starting for  approximately  10 seconds , which is the time required to fill the pump and to start if the key is released before the  end of this \"first starting\" phase. \"Power latch\" is not necessary before attempting to start the vehicle again.\nThis procedure runs when a  computer is replaced  if the parameters relating to the rail pressure have not been  copied into the new computer, or when an injection computer is reprogrammed.\n13B-11 V1 MR-453-X79-13B000$030.mif\nDCM 1.2 injection Program No.: 4C Vdiag No.: 08\nFault finding – System operation 13B\nIdling speed regulation The computer handles the calculation of idling speed. This has to take account of the instantaneous power level to  be supplied, according to the status of the following components: – engine coolant temperature, – gear ratio engaged, – battery charge, – electrical consumers (Additional heating, Air conditioning, Fan Unit, electric windows, etc.) active or inactive, – system faults detected.\nIndividual injector correction (C2I) The  DCM 1.2  system injectors must be calibrated with corrective values to adjust their flow precisely. Each injector  is calibrated for different pressures on a test bench, and its specifications are shown on a label attached to the body  of the injector holders. These individual correction values are entered in the computer EEPROM, which can then  actuate the injectors by taking into account their manufacturing dispersion.\nMeasuring the angular position (Cylinder reference sensor) The angular position is measured using a magneto-inductive sensor triggered by machined teeth on the crankshaft  flywheel. This flywheel has sixty teeth separated by six degrees minus two missing teeth, that form a notch.\nA second sensor (Hall effect) triggered by a machined tooth on the high pressure pump drive pulley (synchronised  with the camshaft), that rotates at half the engine speed, supplies an injection cycle running signal. When comparing  the signals from these two sensors, the APS (Angular Position Subsystem) module of the computer is capable of  providing details of the synchronisation components to the system:  – the angular position of the flywheel – the engine speed, the number of the active injector  – the stage of the injection cycle.  This module also supplies the system with the rotation speed signal.\nFlow capacity function (VLC) Because of the combination of several parameters such as the diesel fuel temperature, part wear, clogging of the  diesel filter etc., the system limit may be reached during its service life. If this happens, the rail pressure cannot be  maintained because the pump lacks the necessary capacity. If the pump lacks the necessary capacity, this  programming will therefore reduce the requested flow to a value that will enable the pressure monitoring system to  control the pressure again. The customer may have noticed a loss of vehicle performance when this program is activated (confirmed by the  Flow capacity function  status).  This is part of normal operation.\n13B-12 V1 MR-453-X79-13B000$030.mif\nDCM 1.2 injection Program No.: 4C Vdiag No.: 08\nFault finding – System operation 13B\nFunction: Air flow management\nEGR valve control The EGR system (Exhaust gas recirculation) comprises a proportional EGR valve, with a built-in valve position  feedback potentiometer. The EGR valve position is controlled by the potentiometer in a closed loop and/or by  changes in the estimated air flow.\nCalculating the air flow The  K9K 790 and 794  engines are not fitted with an air flowmeter. Instead, the amount of fresh inlet air is evaluated  based on the values supplied by the surrounding systems.\nThe (theoretical) air load is calculated using a model with various calculation parameters, which are: – the inlet air temperature measured by a sensor located after the turbocharger and/or after the exchanger (if fitted), – the turbocharging pressure, – the atmospheric pressure (external air), – the EGR valve position, – the fuel flow, – the engine speed.\nThe atmospheric pressure sensor is optional. If fitted, it sends back a signal relating to the atmospheric pressure to  an analogue port on the micro-controller. If not, atmospheric pressure is recovered based on the turbocharger  pressure and the engine field.\nFor  K9K 792 and 796  engines, the flow of fresh air entering the engine is given by a hot wire ratiometric sensor. This  flowmeter is used to manage the amount of exhaust gas to be recirculated to ensure optimum recirculation rates. A  fresh air temperature sensor is integrated into the flowmeter. Air flow measurement allows closed-loop control via  the EGR valve.\nK9K 796 engine: The turbocharging system is made up of a solenoid valve which is used to control the wastegate to adjust the  absolute pressure of the inlet circuit.\nK9K 790, 792, and 794 engines: The turbocharger system is controlled by the inlet pressure and does not need to be controlled by the computer.\nPre-postheating control Pre/postheating control consists of controlling the heater plugs and preheating warning light on the instrument panel.  The heater plugs are activated by a preheating unit (controlled by the injection computer) and power is supplied by  the battery. After the ignition is switched on a preheating delay is activated. The warning light comes on for a time  dependent on the battery voltage, atmospheric pressure and coolant temperature. If the temperature is below a  certain threshold, a postheating function can be used to improve the combustion stability, and consequently engine  operation (reducing unburnt particles and pollutant emissions).\n13B-13 V1 MR-453-X79-13B000$030.mif\nDCM 1.2 injection Program No.: 4C Vdiag No.: 08\nFault finding – System operation 13B\nAir conditioning management assistance For models with air conditioning, the  DCM 1.2  system allows deactivation of the air conditioning under certain  operating conditions: – when requested by the driver, – when starting the engine, – if the engine overheats (in order to reduce the power the engine has to supply), – when the engine speed is kept at a very high level (to protect the compressor), – during transition phases (e.g. high acceleration demand for overtaking, anti-stalling and moving off). These  conditions are only taken into account if they do not occur repeatedly, so as to prevent system instabilities (erratic  deactivation), – when certain faults appear.\nCold loop air conditioning management The air conditioning is the cold loop type and it is managed by the injection computer, which must: – manage the cooling request according to passenger compartment commands and the refrigerant pressure value, – calculate the power absorbed by the compressor (from the refrigerant fluid pressure). – determining the  fan unit  commands according to the vehicle speed and the refrigerant fluid pressure.\nThe driver requests the air conditioning to be switched on by means of the ventilation selector coupled to a switch.  This cooling request is authorised or refused according to the refrigerant pressure measured. If this pressure is  outside the operating limits, the cold loop program is not activated.\nNote: Fan unit  control requests are made from the injection computer. These requests depend on the air conditioning, but also on the engine coolant temperature and vehicle speed.\nThermal regulation of the passenger compartment heating circuit Engines with direct injection systems are characterised by fuel being injected directly into the combustion chamber.  This leads to heat being lost through the upper part of the engine and consequently, the cylinder head cooling circuit  is smaller in size.\nThe effect of this is that the temperature of the coolant which flows through this circuit rises more slowly. This coolant  is also used by the passenger compartment heating system. In very cold conditions, it is therefore difficult to achieve  a comfortable passenger compartment temperature quickly.\nTo limit the time taken to warm up the system, air heating resistors, called passenger compartment heating resistors  (RCH), are fitted into the passenger compartment heating circuit. The  DCM1.2  injection computer determines the  need to control, and physically controls the passenger compartment heating resistors. The injection computer  determines the power control limitation of the passenger compartment heating resistors based on the alternator  charge on one hand, and the inhibition of passenger compartment heating resistors based on engine speed, load  and vehicle speed, on the other.\n13B-14 V1 MR-453-X79-13B000$030.mif\nDCM 1.2 injection Program No.: 4C Vdiag No.: 08\nFault finding – System operation 13B\nInstrument panel display The computer manages the data display on the instrument panel relating to engine operation. There are six functions concerned:  – the  On board diagnostics   MIL  (Malfunction Indicator Lamp), – pre-postheating, – coolant temperature, –  Level 1  (non-critical fault) and  Level 2  (emergency stop) engine faults. – detection of water in the fuel (depending on instrument panel). These six functions are represented using four indicator lights.\nPre-postheating and electronic fault (level 1) indicator light This warning light is used as an operation indicator light for the heater plugs and as a system fault warning light. – Continuously lit during  + after ignition feed : indicates preheating of the plugs. – Flashing after preheating and an automatic  3-second  stop, indicates a  Level 1  fault (indicates a reduced level of  operation and a limited safety level. The user must carry out repairs as soon as possible).\nEngine coolant temperature warning light (level 2) This indicator light is used both as an in-operation indicator light and as a system fault warning light. It illuminates for  3 seconds  when the power comes on (automatic test procedure). Continuously lit during  + after ignition feed : indicates engine overheating or a  level 2  fault.\nOBD warning light This warning light is used to alert the driver of any injection faults causing excessive pollution, or if the  OBD  system  is deactivated. The injection computer requests the illumination of the  OBD  warning light for a present fault only after three  successive driving cycles. The  3 second  visual inspection when the ignition is switched on (automatic test procedure managed by the  instrument panel) is carried out by the injection computer.\n13B-15 V1 MR-453-X79-13B000$030.mif\nDCM 1.2 injection Program No.: 4C Vdiag No.: 08\nFault finding – System operation 13B",

FAULT FINDING PROCEDURE (continued)\nFault finding problems Disconnecting the connectors and/or manipulating the wiring may temporarily remove the cause of a fault. Electrical measurements of voltage, resistance and insulation are generally correct, especially if the fault is not  present when the analysis is made (stored fault).\nVisual inspection Look for damage under the bonnet and in the passenger compartment. Carefully check the fuses, insulators and wiring harness routing. Look for signs of oxidation.\nPhysical inspection While manipulating the wiring, use the diagnostic tool to note any change in fault status from stored to present. Make sure that the connectors are properly locked. Apply light pressure to the connectors. Twist the wiring harness. If there is a change in status, try to locate the source of the fault.\nInspection of each component Disconnect the connectors and check the appearance of the clips and tabs, as well as the crimping (no crimping  on the insulating section). Make sure that the clips and tabs are properly locked in the sockets. Check that no clips or tabs have been dislodged during connection. Check the clip contact pressure using an appropriate model of tab.\nResistance check Check the continuity of entire lines, then section by section. Look for a short circuit to earth, to  + 12 V  or with another wire.\nIf a fault is detected, repair or replace the wiring harness.\n17B - 5 V1 MR-453-X79-17B000$010.mif\nEMS 3130 injection Program No.: EB Vdiag No.: 04\nFault finding – Introduction 17B\nIMPORTANT Any fault on a complex system requires thorough fault finding with the appropriate tools.  The FAULT FINDING LOG, which should be completed during the fault finding procedure,  ensures a record is kept of the procedure carried out. It is an essential document when  consulting the manufacturer.\nIT IS THEREFORE MANDATORY TO FILL OUT A FAULT FINDING LOG WHENEVER THE TECHLINE OR THE WARRANTY RETURNS DEPARTMENT REQUESTS IT.\nYou will always be asked for this log: • when requesting technical assistance from Techline, • for approval requests when replacing parts for which approval is mandatory, • to be attached to monitored parts for which reimbursement is requested. The log is needed for warranty  reimbursement, and enables better analysis of the parts removed.\n17B - 6 V1 MR-453-X79-17B000$010.mif\nEMS 3130 injection Program No.: EB Vdiag No.: 04\nFault finding – Introduction 17B\n6. INSTRUCTIONS TO BE FOLLOWED FOR ANY WORK CARRIED OUT ON THE INJECTION SYSTEM\nInstructions to be followed before opening of the fuel circuit\nUse fresh cleaning agent for each operation (used cleaning agent is contaminated). Pour it into an uncontaminated  container. For each operation, use a clean brush in good condition (the brush must not shed its bristles). Use a brush and cleaning agent to clean the unions to be opened. Blast compressed air over the cleaned parts (tools, workbench, and the parts, unions and injection system area).  Check that no bristles remain. Wash your hands before and during the operation if necessary. When wearing leather protective gloves cover them with latex gloves to prevent contamination.",

Observation of a drop  in torque detects combustion misfires.\nThis fault finding is performed practically continuously while the car is being driven. If it is not carried out, or if a fault  is detected, all other OBD fault finding will be inhibited.\nThis diagnostic strategy makes it possible to diagnose two types of fault: – destructive misfires that damage the catalytic converter, and cause the OBD warning light to begin flashing  immediately, – polluting misfires that result in the OBD pollution limit being exceeded, and cause the OBD warning light to  illuminate if they are detected during three consecutive journeys.\n17B - 19 V1 MR-453-X79-17B000$020.mif\nEMS 3130 injection Program No.: EB Vdiag No.: 04\nFault finding – System operation 17B\nDETECTION CONDITIONS Check that programming has been correctly carried out.

Switching off the ignition will lead to the results being misinterpreted.\nIf after the test, the diagnostic tool has recorded misfires, see the procedures for dealing with faults DF123  Polluting misfire and DF124 Destructive misfire.\nCONFIRMATION OF THE REPAIR –  ET061 Cylinder 1 recognition  is  PERFORMED –  ET422 Combustion misfire diag* included  is  YES . – No fault detected and  OBD warning light off .\nCatalytic converter fault finding The aim of catalytic converter fault finding is to detect a malfunction that causes hydrocarbon pollutant emissions to  exceed the OBD limit. The ability of the catalytic converter to store oxygen indicates its condition. As the catalytic converter ages, its ability  to store oxygen reduces along with its ability to treat pollutant gases.\n17B - 20 V1 MR-453-X79-17B000$020.mif\nEMS 3130 injection Program No.: EB Vdiag No.: 04\nFault finding – System operation 17B\nCONDITIONS FOR STARTING FAULT FINDING Fault finding of the catalytic converter can only take place after the engine has been running for the time detailed in  the following table, if all the conditions prior to switching on the ignition are satisfied and maintained: – no electrical faults, – cylinder 1 position recognition performed, – no combustion misfires detected, – no catalytic converter fault finding performed since the ignition was switched on, – programming done, – main loop and double loop active, – coolant temperature greater than  75ºC .\nEngine Speed,  mph (kph) Engine speed  (rpm)\nStabilisation  time (s) Time before  enabling (min)\nManifold  pressure  (mbar)\nK4M 63/130 1856/3808 400/750 11 17\nFAULT DETECTION Fault finding is performed over a stabilised range in  5 th   gear  at  43 mph  ( 70 km/h ). When the conditions for starting  fault finding are satisfied, richness excitation peaks are applied, having the effect of sending bursts of oxygen into  the catalytic converter. If the catalytic converter is in good condition it absorbs the oxygen and the downstream  oxygen sensor value will remain at its average value. If it is worn, it rejects the oxygen and the oxygen sensor will  start to vibrate. The voltage of the oxygen sensor fluctuates. If the fault is confirmed three consecutive times, the  OBD warning light illuminates.\nThe test cannot last longer than  52 seconds .\nIMPORTANT Do not switch off the ignition before the result is read on the diagnostic tool at the end of each test.  Switching off the ignition will lead to the results being misinterpreted.\nIf after the test, the diagnostic tool recorded an operating fault of the catalytic converter, see the procedure for  dealing with fault DF394 Catalytic converter operating fault.\nCONFIRMATION OF THE REPAIR –  ET345 Catalytic converter fault finding included  is  ACTIVE –  ET349 Catalytic converter fault finding performed  is  YES – No catalytic converter operating fault detected.\n17B - 21 V1 MR-453-X79-17B000$020.mif\nEMS 3130 injection Program No.: EB Vdiag No.: 04\nFault finding – System operation 17B\nOxygen sensor fault finding The purpose of oxygen sensor fault finding is to detect a fault which causes the hydrocarbon pollutant emissions to  exceed the OBD limit. It is performed by measuring and comparing oxygen sensor vibration periods.\nThere are two types of possible faults on the oxygen sensors: – mechanical damage to an electrical component (breakage, cut in wire) which leads to an electrical fault, – chemical damage to the component which causes the response time of the sensor to slow down, thus  increasing its switching period.\nWhen the required test conditions are met, the average of the sensor periods read is taken, subtracting the effects of  interference, then compared with an average period of the OBD limit.\nTEST CONDITIONS Fault finding of the oxygen sensor can only take place after the engine has been running for a while and under  specific operating conditions, detailed in the table below, and if all the conditions prior to the ignition being switched  on are met and maintained: – no electrical faults detected, – programming and cylinder recognition done, – no oxygen sensor fault finding performed since the ignition was switched on, – no combustion misfires detected, – coolant temperature greater than  75ºC .\nEngine Speed,  mph (kph) Engine speed  (rpm)\nStabilisation  time (s) Time before  enabling (min)\nManifold  pressure  (mbar)\nK4M 63/130 1856/3808 380/850 8 14\n17B - 22 V1 MR-453-X79-17B000$020.mif\nEMS 3130 injection Program No.: EB Vdiag No.: 04\nFault finding – System operation 17B\nFAULT DETECTION Fault finding is performed while the vehicle is being driven in one gear, travelling at a steady speed and for the  minimum period of time specified in the following table:\nEngine Gear Speed, mph (kph) Maximum period (s)\nFor this test, the computer inhibits fuel vapour absorber bleeding.

Before any starting request, the injection computer is protected. When a starting request is made, the injection computer and the Passenger Compartment Control Unit (UCH)  exchange authentication data via the multiplex network. This determines whether the engine start is authorised or  denied.\nAfter more than five consecutive failed authentication attempts, the injection computer goes into protection (anti- scanning) mode and no longer tries to authenticate the UCH computer. It only leaves this mode when the following  sequence of operations is carried out: – the ignition is left on for at least  20 seconds ,  – the message is switched off, – the end of the injection computer self-feed is adhered to (the length of time varies depending on engine  temperature).\nAfter this, one and only one authentication attempt is allowed. If this fails again, repeat the sequence of operations  described above. If the injection computer still fails to unlock, contact the Techline.\nImpact detected If an impact has been  stored  by the injection computer, turn off the ignition for  10 seconds , then switch it back on to  start the engine. Clear the faults using the control  RZ001 Fault memory .\nWARNING Disconnect the injection system computer when carrying out any welding work on the vehicle.",

    "page_content": "This programming is used to calculate the adapted idle speed according to the conditions of use (cold engine,  air conditioning requests, electrical consumer use etc.).\nThis is managed by a motorised throttle valve which is controlled by the injection computer. The injection computer also performs the following tasks using the motorised throttle:  – management of valve oscillations which can produce undesirable torque, – management of valve movement subject to mechanical faults when the valve reaches its mechanical boundaries, – management of acoustic faults by limiting throttle opening at a certain engine speed and when stopping the engine.\nThe torque structure is the system for managing engine torque. It is necessary for some functions such as the  electronic stability program (ESP), automatic transmission (BVA) or sequential gearbox (BVR).\nEach computer (ESP, sequential gearbox, automatic transmission) sends a request for torque via the multiplex  network to the injection computer. This arbitrates between the various torque requests and the driver's request  (made via the accelerator pedal or the cruise control/speed limiter).\nThe result of this arbitration gives the torque setpoint. The computer then calculates the throttle position setpoint, the  ignition advance  and the wastegate setpoint  (if a turbocharged engine) in order to provide the necessary torque.\nManagement of ignition advance enables the combustion quality to be managed and therefore engine operation  to be optimised. For a positive advance, the ignition point will be before TDC*, however the advance can have  a negative value. TDC*: Top Dead Centre.",

    "page_content": "The fuel pump ensures the supply of fuel. It is activated for one second each time the + after ignition feed is switched  on. It ensures the correct level of pressure in the circuit and thereby achieves correct engine starting, particularly if  the vehicle has not been used for a long time. When the engine is running, the pump relay is controlled and therefore  the pump is always active. The petrol vapour absorber enables petrol vapour to be collected in order to limit its release into the atmosphere.\nRichness is managed using the upstream and downstream oxygen sensors located on the exhaust. For the sensors  to be operational quickly, they need to be heated by the exhaust gas and by a resistor internal to the sensor. These  sensors reflect the efficiency of combustion and, using information sent to the computer, they enable the quantity of  fuel injected to be managed in order to meet the emission control standards and to ensure optimum engine  operation.\n17B-10 V1 MR-453-X79-17B050$050.mif\nV42 Injection Program No.: 2A Vdiag No.: 04, 06\nFault finding – Features 17B",

For a  stored fault , note the faults displayed and apply the Notes section.\nIf the fault is  confirmed  when the instructions are applied, the fault is present. Deal with the fault. If the fault is  not confirmed , check: – the electrical connections that correspond to the fault, – the connectors for this connection, – the resistance of the faulty component, – the condition of the wires. Refer to paragraphs 4.1 Checking wiring and 4.2 Checking connectors\nThe aim of the conformity check is to check data that does not produce a fault on the  diagnostic tool  when the data  is inconsistent. Therefore, this stage is used to:  – carry out fault finding on faults that do not have a fault display, and which may correspond to a customer complaint, – check that the system is operating correctly and that there is no risk of a fault recurring after repairs.\nThis section gives the fault finding procedures for statuses and parameters and the conditions for checking them.\nIf a status is not behaving normally or a parameter is outside the permitted tolerance values, consult the  corresponding fault finding page.",

FAULT FINDING PROCEDURE (CONTINUED)\nFault finding problems Disconnecting the connectors and/or manipulating the wiring may temporarily remove the cause of a fault.\nVisual inspection Look for damage under the bonnet and in the passenger compartment. Carefully check the protectors, insulation, and routing of the wiring, as well as the mountings.\nPhysical inspection While manipulating the wiring, use either the  diagnostic tool  to detect a change in status from “stored” to “present”,  or use the multimeter to view the status changes. Make sure that the connectors are properly locked. Apply light pressure to the connectors. Twist the wiring harness.\nChecking earth insulation This check is carried out by measuring the voltage (multimeter in voltmeter mode) between the suspect connection  and the  12 V  or  5 V . The correct measured value is  0 V.\nChecking insulation against + 12 V or + 5 V This check is carried out by measuring the voltage (multimeter in voltmeter mode) between the suspect connection  and the earth. In the first instance, the earth may be taken on the chassis. The correct measured value should be  0 V\nContinuity check A continuity check is carried out by measuring the resistance (multimeter in ohmmeter mode), with the connectors  disconnected at both ends. The expected result is  1  ΩΩΩΩ  ± 1  ΩΩΩΩ  for every connection. The line must be fully checked,  and the intermediate connections are only included in the method if this saves time during the fault finding  procedure. The continuity check on the multiplex lines must be carried out on both wires. The measured value  should be  1   Ω   ± 1   Ω .\nChecking the supply This check may be carried out using a test light ( 21 W  or  5 W  depending on the maximum authorised load).\n36B-5 V1 MR-453-X79-36B000$010.mif\nPOWER-ASSISTED STEERING PUMP ASSEMBLY Fault finding – Introduction 36B\n4.2 Checking the connectors\nNote: Carry out each requested check visually.  Do not remove a connector if it is not required.\nNote: Repeated connections and disconnections alter the functionality of the connectors and increase the risk of poor  electrical contact. Limit the number of connections/disconnections as much as possible.\nNote: The check is carried out on the 2 parts of the connection. There may be two types of connection: – Connector/Connector. – Connector/Device.\nVisual inspection of the connection: – Check that the connector is connected correctly and that the male and female parts of the connection are  correctly coupled.\nVisual inspection of the area around the connection: – Check the condition of the mounting (pin, strap, adhesive tape, etc.) if the connectors are attached to the  vehicle. – Check that there is no damage to the wiring trim (sheath, foam, adhesive tape, etc.) near the wiring. – Check that there is no damage to the electrical wires at the connector outputs, in particular on the insulating  material (wear, cuts, burns, etc.).\nDisconnect the connector to continue the checks.\nVisual inspection of the plastic casing: – Check that there is no mechanical damage (casing crushed, split, broken, etc.), in particular to the fragile  components (lever, lock, sockets, etc.). – Check that there is no heat damage (casing melted, darker, deformed, etc.). – Check that there are no stains (grease, mud, liquid, etc.).\nVisual inspection of the metal contacts: (The female contact is called CLIP. The male contact is called TAB). – Check that there are no bent contacts (the contact is not inserted correctly and can come out of the back of  the connector). The contact comes out of the connector when the wire is pulled gently. – Check that there is no damage (folded tabs, clips open too wide, blackened or melted contact, etc.). – Check that there is no oxidation on the metal contacts.\n36B-6 V1 MR-453-X79-36B000$010.mif\nPOWER-ASSISTED STEERING PUMP ASSEMBLY Fault finding – Introduction 36B\nVisual inspection of the sealing: (Only for watertight connectors) Check for the seal on the connection (between the 2 parts of the connection). – Check the seal at the back of the connectors: –  For  unit   joints (1 for each wire), check that the unit joints are present on each electrical wire and that they are  correctly positioned in the opening (level with the housing). Check that plugs are present on openings which  are not used. –  For a   grommet  seal (one seal which covers the entire internal surface of the connector), check that the seal is present. –  For  gel  seals, check for gel in all of the sockets without removing the excess or any protruding sections (it does not  matter if there is gel on the contacts). –  For  hotmelt  sealing (heat-shrink sheath with glue), check that the sheath has contracted correctly on the rear of the  connectors and the electrical wires, and that the hardened glue comes out of the side of the wire. – Check that there is no damage to any of the seals (cuts, burns, significant deformation, etc.).\nIf a fault is detected, consult  Technical Note 6015A, Repairing electrical wiring.\n36B-7 V1 MR-453-X79-36B000$010.mif\nPOWER-ASSISTED STEERING PUMP ASSEMBLY Fault finding – Introduction 36B\nIMPORTANT Any fault on a complex system requires thorough fault finding with the appropriate tools. The  FAULT FINDING LOG, which should be completed during the fault finding procedure, ensures a  record is kept of the procedure carried out. It is an essential document when consulting the  manufacturer.\nIT IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL THAT THE FAULT FINDING LOG IS FILLED OUT EVERY TIME IT IS  REQUESTED BY TECHLINE OR THE WARRANTY RETURNS DEPARTMENT.\nYou will always be asked for this log: – when requesting technical assistance from Techline, – for approval requests when replacing parts for which approval is mandatory, – to be attached to monitored parts for which reimbursement is requested. The log is needed for warranty  reimbursement, and enables better analysis of the parts removed.",

Correct system operation is checked using sensors integrated into the pump assembly of the power-assisted  steering.\nThe power-assisted steering is only available when the  + after ignition feed  is on (computer activation) and the  vehicle's engine is running (the presence of the alternator signal is interpreted by the computer as \"engine running\"). The power-assisted steering is only switched off if the after ignition feed and alternator signal disappear and the  speed is less than  2 mph (3 km/h) .\nThe level of assistance calculated is based on parameters defined by Renault (tuning or assistance strategy) and  stored in the computer memory. This assistance strategy should be entered after replacing the  pump assembly* of  DUSTER .\n• When the vehicle speed is absent, or received but invalid, then the level of assistance provided corresponds to the  level of assistance for  60 mph (100km/h) . In this case, power-assisted steering is available but is not optimal.  Heavy steering is easily perceived when stationary. The higher the vehicle speed, the more limited the power-assisted steering assistance.  The  DUSTER GEP*  is  a variable power-assisted steering system, which varies according to the vehicle speed.\n• The assistance is available more or less immediately when the vehicle is started. Two cases can be identified: – The ignition is on but the engine is not started immediately. This allows time for the GEP* to perform its  initialisation sequence ( 500 ms  approximately). As soon as the engine is  running , the GEP* supplies  assistance with a gradient of  100%/s . – The ignition is on and the engine is started immediately. The GEP* starts the initialisation phase  immediately followed by a gradient of  100%/s .\nThe power-assisted steering can be maintained in degraded mode then reduced gradually for the following  5  minutes  until assistance stops completely. This particular mode is active when the signal connector is disconnected.\nFault finding only operates when the  GEP  supply voltage is between 9 V  and 18 V . Abnormal levels of voltage, which  are out of range, may generate noticeable variations in assistance.\n36B-11 V1 MR-453-X79-36B000$030.mif\nPOWER-ASSISTED STEERING PUMP ASSEMBLY Fault finding – Function 36B\n• Temperature Protection Function\nThe temperature of the pump assembly is monitored by two sensors, one for the oil temperature, the other for the  temperature of the internal electronics.\nThere are two possible cases: • When at least one of the two temperatures ( PR008 COMPUTER TEMPERATURE and PR016 OIL  TEMPERATURE ) exceeds the threshold of  107˚C , the rotation speed of the electric motor decreases  until  the temperature drops below this threshold.  • When at least one of the two temperatures ( PR008 COMPUTER TEMPERATURE  and  PR016 OIL  TEMPERATURE ) exceeds the threshold of  125˚C , the electric pump switches off and no assistance is  provided for as long as it takes for the temperature to return below this threshold.\n• Fault finding function\nThe pump assembly computer includes a self-test procedure function. The required information can be accessed  using the  diagnostic tool , by the  HK  line.\n36B-12 V1 MR-453-X79-36B000$030.mif\nPOWER-ASSISTED STEERING PUMP ASSEMBLY Fault finding – Configuration",

    "page_content": "Fault finding – Introduction 38C\n4. FAULT FINDING PROCEDURE (CONTINUED)\nFault finding problems Disconnecting the connectors and/or manipulating the wiring may temporarily remove the cause of a fault.\nVisual inspection Look for damage under the bonnet and in the passenger compartment. Carefully check the protectors, insulation, and routing of the wiring, as well as the mountings.\nPhysical inspection While manipulating the wiring, use either the  diagnostic tool  to detect a change in status from \"stored\" to \"present\",  or use the multimeter to view the status changes. Make sure that the connectors are properly locked. Apply light pressure to the connectors. Twist the wiring harness.\nChecking earth insulation This check is carried out by measuring the voltage (multimeter in voltmeter mode) between the suspect connection  and the  12 V  or  5 V . The correct measured value is  0 V .\nChecking insulation against + 12 V or + 5 V This check is carried out by measuring the voltage (multimeter in voltmeter mode) between the suspect  connection and the earth. In the first instance, the earth may be taken on the chassis. The correct measured  value should be  0 V\nContinuity check A continuity check is carried out by measuring the resistance (multimeter in ohmmeter mode), with the connectors  disconnected at both ends. The expected result is  1  ΩΩΩΩ  ± 1  ΩΩΩΩ  for every connection. The line must be fully checked,  and the intermediate connections are only included in the method if this saves time during the fault finding  procedure. The continuity check on the multiplex lines must be carried out on both wires. The measured value  should be  1  ΩΩΩΩ  ± 1  ΩΩΩΩ .\nChecking the supply This check may be carried out using a test light ( 21 W  or  5 W  depending on the maximum authorised load).\n38C-5 V1 MR-453-X79-38C000$010.mif\nABS BOSCH 8.1 Vdiag No.: 04\nFault finding – Introduction 38C\n4.2 Checking the connectors\nNote: Carry out each requested check visually.  Do not remove a connector if it is not required.\nNote: Repeated connections and disconnections alter the functionality of the connectors and increase the risk of poor  electrical contact. Limit the number of connections/disconnections as much as possible.\nNote: The check is carried out on the 2 parts of the connection. There may be two types of connection: – Connector/Connector. – Connector/Device.\nVisual inspection of the connection: – Check that the connector is connected correctly and that the male and female parts of the connection are correctly  coupled.\nVisual inspection of the area around the connection: – Check the condition of the mounting (pin, strap, adhesive tape, etc.) if the connectors are attached to the vehicle. – Check that there is no damage to the wiring trim (sheath, foam, adhesive tape, etc.) near the wiring. – Check that there is no damage to the electrical wires at the connector outputs, in particular on the insulating material  (wear, cuts, burns, etc.).\nDisconnect the connector to continue the checks.\nVisual inspection of the plastic casing: – Check that there is no mechanical damage (casing crushed, split, broken, etc.), in particular to the fragile  components (lever, lock, sockets, etc.). – Check that there is no heat damage (casing melted, darker, deformed, etc.). – Check that there are no stains (grease, mud, liquid, etc.).\nVisual inspection of the metal contacts: (The female contact is called CLIP. The male contact is called TAB). – Check that there are no bent contacts (the contact is not inserted correctly and can come out of the back of the  connector). The contact comes out of the connector when the wire is pulled gently. – Check that there is no damage (folded tabs, clips open too wide, blackened or melted contact, etc.). – Check that there is no oxidation on the metal contacts.\n38C-6 V1 MR-453-X79-38C000$010.mif\nABS BOSCH 8.1 Vdiag No.: 04\nFault finding – Introduction 38C\nVisual inspection of the sealing: (Only for watertight connectors) Check for the seal on the connection (between the 2 parts of the connection). – Check the seal at the back of the connectors: – For  unit  joints (1 for each wire), check that the unit joints are present on each electrical wire and that they  are correctly positioned in the opening (level with the housing). Check that plugs are present on openings  which are not used. – For a  grommet  seal (one seal which covers the entire internal surface of the connector), check that the seal  is present. – For gel seals, check for gel in all of the sockets without removing the excess or any protruding sections  (it does not matter if there is gel on the contacts). – For  hotmelt  sealing (heat-shrink sheath with glue), check that the sheath has contracted correctly on the  rear of the connectors and the electrical wires, and that the hardened glue comes out of the side of the wire. – Check that there is no damage to any of the seals (cuts, burns, significant deformation, etc.).\nIf a fault is detected, consult  Technical Note 6015A, Repairing electrical wiring .\n38C-7 V1 MR-453-X79-38C000$010.mif\nABS BOSCH 8.1 Vdiag No.: 04\nFault finding – Introduction 38C\nIMPORTANT Any fault on a complex system requires thorough fault finding with the appropriate tools.  The FAULT FINDING LOG, which should be completed during the fault finding procedure,  ensures a record is kept of the procedure carried out. It is an essential document when  consulting the manufacturer.\nIT IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL THAT THE FAULT FINDING LOG IS FILLED OUT EVERY TIME IT IS  REQUESTED BY TECHLINE OR THE WARRANTY RETURNS DEPARTMENT.\nYou will always be asked for this log: – when requesting technical assistance from Techline, – for approval requests when replacing parts for which approval is mandatory, – to be attached to monitored parts for which reimbursement is requested. The log is needed for warranty  reimbursement, and enables better analysis of the parts removed.",

In case of poor traction, the wheels can tend to slow down and slip,  resulting in a loss of vehicle stability. The  MSR  requests the engine to increase its torque to prevent the drive wheels from locking.\nThe  ABS  prevents the wheels from locking when braking. This function allows the vehicle to be steered under  braking and ensures vehicle stability under braking.\nEBD (electronic braking distribution):\nThe electronic braking distribution unit optimises the brakeforce distribution between the front and rear axles.  This function ensures vehicle stability under braking.",

Use parameters  PR001 Front right-hand wheel speed, PR002 Front left-hand wheel speed, PR003 Rear  right-hand wheel speed  and  PR004 Rear left-hand wheel speed  by turning the relevant wheels and checking  the consistency of the results obtained. If the value measured is zero, rotate the other wheels to confirm an electrical inversion of the sensors and repair  the wiring harness. – Possible inversion of pipes on the hydraulic unit. Use commands  AC003 Front left-hand wheel solenoid valves, AC004 Front right-hand wheel solenoid  valves, AC005 Rear left-hand wheel solenoid valves  and  AC006 Rear right-hand wheel solenoid valves   while depressing the brake pedal and check for the occurrence of locking/unlocking cycles on the wheel  concerned (see  Command summary table ). If the cycles do not occur on the wheel tested (wheel remains  locked), check whether they occur on another wheel to confirm reversed pipes. If the cycles do not occur on one wheel and the pipes have not been inverted, contact the Techline.\nCheck that the wheel speed sensor mounting is in good condition (clipping). Visually inspect the condition of the target (clogging, metallic contamination, etc.) and clean with compressed air  if necessary.

    "page_content": "Note: Carry out each requested check visually. Do not remove a connector if it is not required.\nNote: Repeated connections and disconnections alter the functionality of the connectors and increase the risk of poor  electrical contact. Limit the number of connections/disconnections as much as possible.\nNote: The check is carried out on the 2 parts of the connection. There may be two types of connection: – Connector / Connector – Connector / Device\nFault finding problems Disconnecting the connectors and/or manipulating the wiring may temporarily clear the cause of a fault. Electrical measurements of voltage, resistance and insulation are generally correct, especially if the fault is not  present when the analysis is made (stored fault).\nVisual inspection of the connection: • Check that the connector is connected correctly and that the male and female parts of the connection are correctly  coupled.\nVisual inspection of the area around the connection: • Check the condition of the mounting (pin, strap, adhesive tape, etc.) if the connectors are attached to the vehicle. • Check that there is no damage to the wiring trim (sheath, foam, adhesive tape, etc.) near the wiring. • Check that there is no damage to the electrical wires at the connector outputs, in particular on the insulating material  (wear, cuts, burns, etc.).\nDisconnect the connector to continue the checks.\nVisual inspection of the plastic casing: • Check that there is no mechanical damage (casing crushed, cracked, broken, etc.), in particular to the fragile  components (lever, lock, openings, etc.). • Check that there is no heat damage (casing melted, darker, deformed, etc.). • Check that there are no stains (grease, mud, liquid, etc.).\nVisual inspection of the metal contacts: (The female contact is called CLIP. The male contact is called TAB). • Check that there are no bent contacts (the contact is not inserted correctly and can come out of the back of the  connector). The spring contact of the connector when the wire is gently pulled. • Check that there is no damage (folded tabs, clips open too wide, blackened or melted contact, etc.). • Check that there is no oxidation on the metal contacts.\n61A-3 V1 MR-453-X79-61A000$010.mif\nFault finding – Introduction 61A\nVisual inspection of the sealing: (Only for watertight connectors) • Check for the seal on the connection (between the 2 parts of the connection). • Check the seal at the back of the connectors: –  For unit  joints (1 for each wire), check that the unit joints are present on each electrical wire and that they  are correctly positioned in the opening (level with the housing). Check that plugs are present on openings  which are not used. – For a  grommet  seal (one seal which covers the entire internal surface of the connector), check that the seal  is present. – For  gel  seals, check for gel in all of the openings without removing the excess or any protruding sections  (it does not matter if there is gel on the contacts). – For  hotmelt  sealing (heat-shrink sheath with glue), check that the sheath has contracted correctly on the  rear of the connectors and electrical wires, and that the hardened glue comes out of the side of the wire. • Check that there is no damage to any of the seals (cuts, burns, significant deformation, etc.).\nIf a fault is detected, repair or replace the wiring (see  Technical Note 6015A, Electrical wiring repair, Wiring:  Precautions for repair )\n61A-4 V1 MR-453-X79-61A000$010.mif\nFault finding – Introduction 61A\nIMPORTANT All faults involving a complex system call for thorough diagnostics with the appropriate tools.  The FAULT FINDING LOG, which should be completed during the fault finding procedure,  ensures a record is kept of the procedure carried out. It is an essential document when  consulting the manufacturer.\nIT IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL THAT THE FAULT FINDING LOG IS FILLED OUT EVERY TIME IT IS  REQUESTED BY TECHLINE OR THE WARRANTY RETURNS DEPARTMENT\nYou will always be asked for this log: • when requesting technical assistance from the Techline, • when requesting approval before replacing parts for which approval is compulsory, • to be attached to monitored parts for which reimbursement is requested. The log is needed for warranty  reimbursement, and enables better analysis of the parts removed.",

The  present  or  stored  status of the fault should be considered when   the diagnostic tool is switched on after  the + after ignition feed is switched on (without any action on the system components).\nFor a  present fault , apply the procedure described in the  Interpretation of faults  section. For a  stored fault , note the faults displayed and apply the  Notes  section. If the fault is  confirmed  when the instructions are applied, the fault is present. Deal with the fault.\nIf the fault is  not confirmed , check: – the electrical lines which correspond to the fault, – the connectors on these lines (corrosion, bent pins, etc.), – the resistance of the faulty component, – the condition of the wires (melted or split insulation, wear).\nThe aim of the conformity check is to check data that does not produce a fault on the  diagnostic tool  when the data  is inconsistent. Therefore, this stage is used to:\n– carry out fault finding on faults that do not have a fault display, and which may correspond to a customer  complaint, – check that the system is operating correctly and that there is no risk of a fault recurring after repairs.\nThis section gives the fault finding procedures for statuses and parameters and the conditions for checking them. If a status is not behaving normally or a parameter is outside the permitted tolerance values, consult the  corresponding fault finding page.\n62C-3 V1 MR-453-X79-62C000$010.mif\nFault finding – Introduction 62C\nSpecial notes on the conformity check for the air conditioning function:\nThe  air conditioning system  conformity check is divided into four parts. The parts relate to the four sub-functions of  the air conditioning system: heating, cold loop, user selection and passenger compartment ventilation. The statuses  and parameters related to these sub-functions are listed with their respective computers.\nSpecial notes:  The air conditioning control panel does not control electrical components (other than the passenger  compartment fan assembly) and it cannot support fault finding.\nNote: The interpretation of statuses, parameters and commands is also split into several sections. Everything controlled  by the air conditioning control panel is explained in the two  Air conditioning  sections ( 62B and 62C ). On the other  hand, signals from other computers are explained in the fault finding sections for these computers (see  conformity  check ).",

Do not remove a connector if it is not required.\nNote: Repeated connections and disconnections alter the functionality of the connectors and increase the risk of poor  electrical contact. Limit the number of connections/disconnections as much as possible.\nNote: The check is carried out on the 2 parts of the connection. There may be two types of connection: – Connector / Connector – Connector / Device\nFault finding problems Disconnecting the connectors and/or manipulating the wiring may temporarily remove the cause of a fault. Electrical measurements of voltage, resistance and insulation are generally correct, especially if the fault is not  present when the analysis is made (stored fault).\nVisual inspection of the connection: • Check that the connector is connected correctly and that the male and female parts of the connection are  correctly coupled.\nVisual inspection of the area around the connection: • Check the condition of the mounting (pin, strap, adhesive tape, etc.), that the connectors are attached to the  vehicle. • Check that there is no damage to the wiring trim (sheath, foam, adhesive tape, etc.) near the wiring. • Check that there is no damage to the electrical wires at the connector outputs, in particular on the insulating  material (wear, cuts, burns, etc.).\nDisconnect the connector to continue the checks.\nVisual inspection of the plastic casings: • Check that there is no mechanical damage (casing crushed, cracked, broken, etc.), in particular to the fragile  components (lever, lock, openings, etc.). • Check that there is no heat damage (casing melted, darker, deformed, etc.). • Check that there are no stains (grease, mud, liquid, etc.).\nVisual inspection of the metal contacts: (The female contact is called CLIP. The male contact is called TAB). • Check that there are no bent contacts (the contact is not inserted correctly and can come out of the back of  the connector). The spring contact of the connector when pulling the wire slightly. • Check that there is no damage (folded tabs, clips open too wide, blackened or melted contact, etc.). • Check that there is no oxidation on the metal contacts.\n62C-6 V1 MR-453-X79-62C000$010.mif\nFault finding – Introduction 62C\nVisual inspection of the sealing: (Only for watertight connectors) • Check for the seal on the connection (between the 2 parts of the connection). • Check the seal at the back of the connectors: – For  unit  joints (1 for each wire), check that the unit joints are present on each electrical wire and that they  are correctly positioned in the opening (level with the housing). Check that plugs are present on openings  which are not used. – For a  grommet  seal (one seal which covers the entire internal surface of the connector), check that the  seal is present. – For  gel  seals, check for gel in all of the sockets without removing the excess or any protruding sections  (it does not matter if there is gel on the contacts). – For  hotmelt  sealing (heat-shrink sheath with glue), check that the sheath has contracted correctly on the  rear of the connectors and electrical wires, and that the hardened glue comes out of the side of the wire. • Check that there is no damage to any of the seals (cuts, burns, significant deformation, etc.).\nIf a fault is detected, repair or replace the wiring (see  Technical Note 6015A, Electrical wiring repair, Wiring:  Precautions for repair )\n62C-7 V1 MR-453-X79-62C000$010.mif\nFault finding – Introduction 62C\nIMPORTANT Any fault on a complex system requires thorough fault finding with the appropriate tools.  The FAULT FINDING LOG, which should be completed during the fault finding procedure,  ensures a record is kept of the procedure carried out. It is an essential document when  consulting the manufacturer.\nIT IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL THAT THE FAULT FINDING LOG IS FILLED OUT EVERY TIME IT IS  REQUESTED BY TECHLINE OR THE WARRANTY RETURNS DEPARTMENT.\nYou will always be asked for this log: • when requesting technical assistance from Techline, • for approval requests when replacing parts for which approval is mandatory, • to be attached to monitored parts for which reimbursement is requested. The log is needed for warranty  reimbursement, and enables better analysis of the parts removed.",

The pressure can reach up to  28 bar .\n– Condenser: The condenser is composed of flat horizontal aluminium tubes. The pipes are divided by the vanes in order  to increase the air heat exchange and therefore cool the refrigerant fluid to produce condensation.\n1) Condenser 2) Dehydrator reservoir\n62C-12 V1 MR-453-X79-62C000$030.mif\nFault finding – Role of components 62C\n– Dehydrator reservoir: (see figure above)\nThe dehydrator reservoir is used to: • Check the condition of the refrigerant. • Absorb the variations in volume (expansion bottle principle). • Filter impurities. • Absorb moisture (water in the circuit).\n– Heating and air conditioning assembly: (see figure above)\nThis unit acts as an air mixing box. It is equipped with a system of flaps which allow the air to be directed in  accordance with the requirements of the occupants whilst simultaneously allowing the temperature of the air  entering the passenger compartment to be modified by mixing hot and cold air.\n– Thermostatic expansion valve: (see figure below)\nThis thermostatic-type expansion valve is used to check refrigerant expansion. It is located at the  evaporator inlet.\n– Evaporator: (see figure below)\n• The evaporator is a heat exchanger which enables the air entering the passenger compartment to be cooled.\nNote: Condensation of the air may occur thereby causing normal drops of water to form underneath the  vehicle body.\n1) Expansion valve 2) Evaporator\n62C-13 V1 MR-453-X79-62C000$030.mif\nFault finding – Role of components 62C\n– High and low pressure pipes:\n• The  High Pressure  and  Low Pressure  pipes are composed of rigid aluminium pipes and flexible pipes which  enable engine-related movements to be absorbed.\n• Two filler valves (on the  High Pressure  pipe and on the  Low Pressure  pipe) can be accessed in order to fill  (or drain) the refrigerant loop.\n• The connections must be checked in the event of a refrigerant fluid leak.\n1) Buffering capacity 2) Expansion valve outlet 3) Expansion valve inlet 4) High pressure filler valve 5) Low pressure filler valve 6) Condenser inlet 7) Condenser outlet 8) Pressure sensor 9) Compressor inlet 10) Compressor outlet\nFigure 6: Cold loop pipes\n– Heater matrix:  The external air entering the heating and air conditioning system ( HVAC ) is heated by the  heater matrix .\n62C-14 V1 MR-453-X79-62C000$030.mif\nFault finding – Role of components 62C\n– Passenger compartment heating resistors (depending on the equipment level):  The passenger compartment heating resistors (RCH) are electrical heating devices in the air conditioning unit.  This system is an additional heating system which operates when the engine is cold (when starting).\n– Air distribution flap:\nThis flap enables the air flowing into the passenger compartment to be directed.\nThis flap mixes the air in order to meet the temperature requirements of the occupants.\n– Recirculation flap:\nThis flap prevents the entry of exterior air. In this case, the passenger compartment is isolated from the  exterior and air is blown in the passenger compartment in a closed circuit.\nThese three flaps are  controlled by a cable .\n– Passenger compartment blower unit:\nThe passenger compartment fan assembly is controlled by the Resistive Blower Dimmer Module ( MVPR ).\n62C-15 V1 MR-453-X79-62C000$030.mif\nFault finding – Role of components 62C\nResistive Blower Dimmer Module (MVPR)\n1) Thermal fuse 2) Fan assembly connector 3) Connector to Control panel\nThe passenger compartment fan assembly is used to vary the rate at which air is blown into the passenger  compartment, depending on the requirements of the customer.\n– Cooling fan assembly:\nThe cooling fan assembly motor is normally used in order to promote heat exchange in the condenser and  therefore improve the performance of the air conditioning system. Activation of the air conditioning fan unit  depends, among other things, on the vehicle speed and high pressure in the loop.\nThe air flows into an open air inlet scoop towards the exterior. Therefore there must be enough air flow for it  to be channelled into the passenger compartment. This flow can be created by the vehicle speed (in non- recirculation mode) or by activating the blower. The air flowing into the passenger compartment is protected  by a grille and a rain shield in order to prevent foreign bodies and water from entering. The air is then  distributed inside the passenger compartment.\n62C-16 V1 MR-453-X79-62C000$030.mif\nFault finding – Operating diagram\nSummary diagram of all the components of the air conditioning system\n1) Evaporator 2) Temperature sensor 3) Compressor 4) Condenser 5) Fan assembly 6) Pressure switch 7) Dehydrator reservoir 8) Expansion valve\n62C-17 V1 MR-453-X79-62C000$040.mif\nFault finding – Function\nLayout of the air conditioning function:\nThe functions provided by the system are the thermal comfort of the occupants (warming and cooling), visibility  through the windscreen, as well as the isolation of the passenger compartment in case of exterior air pollution.  The heating and air conditioning system dries and purifies the air in the passenger compartment. Only manual  heating and air conditioning is available for  DUSTER .\nThe injection computer controls the passenger compartment heating resistors (depending on the equipment). It authorises or denies compressor activation depending on the vehicle operation and refrigerant pressure.\nManual air conditioning system control panel: front panel\nManual air conditioning system control panel: rear panel\n62C-18 V1 MR-453-X79-62C000$050.mif\nFault finding – Function 62C\nButtons with operation indicator lamps:  • Air conditioning button.\nManual controls: • Mixing: rotary control on the right-hand side, with cable connection to the flap. • Distribution: rotary control on the left-hand side, with cable connection to the flap. • Recirculation: rotary lever in the centre, with cable connection to the flap. • Air flow V0, V1 to V4 by rotary control in the centre.\nDescription of the sub-functions:\nHeating sub-function : this sub-function includes everything relating to the  production of warm air  in the vehicle  and management of the heated rear screen.\nThe UCH computer controls the rear screen de-icing.

If any of the  above are present, replace the battery and clean the surrounding area.  Check that the degassing pipe is properly connected to the battery vent.\nCheck that the degassing pipe (4) is correctly positioned.\n80A-2 V1 MR-453-X79-80A000$010.mif\n● All vehicles are equipped with low water consumption batteries. Opening the battery and topping up the electrolyte  level are PROHIBITED.\n● Batteries contain sulphuric acid, which is a hazardous chemical.\n● Battery charging produces hydrogen and oxygen, which are very flammable gases and thus there is a risk of  explosion.\n● Any batteries with filling plugs must not be opened under any circumstances but replaced immediately with Renault  approved batteries.\nWhen parked, vehicles consume power through their permanent consumers and through any accessories fitted as  After-Sales options. To keep battery discharging to a minimum, limit the number of times the vehicle is started,  periods with the ignition on, doors open, etc., as much as possible. A discharged battery must be recharged using a Renault-approved battery charger (see  Technical Note 6512A  Battery charging )\n● Simultaneous recharging of several batteries in series or in parallel is forbidden.\n● A battery charger used on a battery connected to a vehicle can irreparably damage the vehicle computers due  to the high voltages created when charging.\n● The location of the charger must take this into account (ventilation).\n● A battery charger or a booster not approved by Renault can damage the electrical components.\nEven when stored off the vehicle, a battery gradually discharges, and more rapidly if the ambient temperature is  high. In order that a battery remains operational for a long time, it must be stored at a temperature of around  15˚C  and protected from humidity. To retain a good level of charge, it is recommended that a battery is completely  recharged after it has been stored for 3 months. A new battery that has been stored for more than one year must not be fitted to a vehicle.\n80A-3 V1 MR-453-X79-80A000$020.mif",

For a  stored fault , note the faults displayed and apply the Notes section.\nIf the fault is  confirmed  when the instructions are applied, the fault is present. Deal with the fault. If the fault is  not confirmed , check: – the electrical connections that correspond to the fault, – the connectors for this connection, – the resistance of the faulty component, – the condition of the wires. Refer to paragraphs 4.1 Checking wiring and 4.2 Checking connectors\nThe aim of the conformity check is to check data which does not produce a fault on  the diagnostic tool  when the  data is inconsistent. Therefore, this stage is used to:  – carry out fault finding on faults that do not have a fault display, and which may correspond to a customer complaint, – check that the system is operating correctly and that there is no risk of a fault recurring after repair.\nThis section gives the fault finding procedures for statuses and parameters and the conditions for checking them.\nIf a status is not behaving normally or a parameter is outside permitted tolerance values, you should consult the  corresponding fault finding page.",

Carefully check the protectors, insulation, and routing of the wiring, as well as the mountings.\nPhysical inspection When manipulating the wiring, either use the  diagnostic tool  to detect a change in status, from \"stored\" to \"present\",  or the multimeter to view the status changes. Make sure that the connectors are firmly secured. Apply light pressure to the connectors. Twist the wiring harness.\nChecking earth insulation This check is carried out by measuring the voltage (multimeter in voltmeter mode) between the suspect connection  and the  12 V  or  5 V . The correct measured value is  0 V.\nChecking insulation against + 12 V or + 5 V This check is carried out by measuring the voltage (multimeter in voltmeter mode) between the suspect connection  and the earth. In the first instance, the earth may be taken on the chassis. The correct measured value should be  0 V\nContinuity check A continuity check is carried out by measuring the resistance (multimeter in ohmmeter mode), with the connectors  disconnected at both ends. The expected result is  1   Ω   ± 1   Ω   for each connection. The line must be fully checked,  and the intermediate connections are only included in the method if this saves time during the fault finding  procedure. The continuity check on the multiplex lines must be carried out on both wires. The measured value  should be  1  ΩΩΩΩ  ± 1  ΩΩΩΩ .\nChecking the supply This check may be carried out using a test light ( 21 W  or  5 W  depending on the maximum authorised load).\n82D-5 V1 MR-453-X79-82D000$010.mif\nFault finding – Introduction 82D\nNote: Carry out each requested check visually.  Do not remove a connector if it is not required.\nNote: Repeated connections and disconnections alter the functionality of the connectors and increase the risk of poor  electrical contact. Limit the number of connections/disconnections as much as possible.\nNote: The check is carried out on the 2 parts of the connection. There may be two types of connection: – Connector/Connector. – Connector/Device.\nVisual inspection of the connection: – Check that the connector is connected correctly and that the male and female parts of the connection are correctly  coupled.\nVisual inspection of the area around the connection: – Check the condition of the mounting (pin, strap, adhesive tape, etc.) if the connectors are attached to the vehicle. – Check that there is no damage to the wiring trim (sheath, foam, adhesive tape, etc.) near the wiring. – Check that there is no damage to the electrical wires at the connector outputs, in particular on the insulating material  (wear, cuts, burns, etc.).\nDisconnect the connector to continue the checks.\nVisual inspection of the plastic casing: – Check that there is no mechanical damage (casing crushed, cracked, broken, etc.), in particular to the fragile  components (lever, lock, openings, etc.). – Check that there is no heat damage (casing melted, darker, deformed, etc.). – Check that there are no stains (grease, mud, liquid, etc.).\n• Visual inspection of the metal contacts: (The female contact is called CLIP. The male contact is called TAB). – Check that there are no bent contacts (the contact is not inserted correctly and can come out of the back of the  connector). The contact comes out of the connector when the wire is pulled gently. – Check that there is no damage (folded tabs, clips open too wide, blackened or melted contact, etc.). – Check that there is no oxidation on the metal contacts.\n82D-6 V1 MR-453-X79-82D000$010.mif\nFault finding – Introduction 82D\n• Visual inspection of the sealing: (Only for watertight connectors) Check for the seal on the connection (between the 2 parts of the connection). – Check the seal at the back of the connectors: – For unit  joints   (1 for each wire), check that the unit joints are present on each electrical wire and that they are  correctly positioned in the opening (level with the housing). Check that plugs are present on openings which are  not used. – For a   grommet  seal (one seal which covers the entire internal surface of the connector), check that the seal is present. – For  gel  seals, check for gel in all of the openings without removing the excess or any protruding sections (it does not matter  if there is gel on the contacts). – For  hotmelt  sealing (heat-shrink sheath with glue), check that the sheath has contracted correctly on the rear of the  connectors and electrical wires, and that the hardened glue comes out of the side of the wire. – Check that there is no damage to any of the seals (cuts, burns, significant deformation, etc.).\nIf a fault is detected, consult  Technical Note 6015A, Repairing electrical wiring.\nIMPORTANT Any fault on a complex system requires thorough fault finding with the appropriate tools.  The FAULT FINDING LOG, which should be completed during the fault finding procedure,  ensures a record is kept of the procedure carried out. It is an essential document when  consulting the manufacturer.\nIT IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL THAT THE FAULT FINDING LOG IS FILLED OUT EVERY TIME IT IS  REQUESTED BY TECHLINE OR THE WARRANTY RETURNS DEPARTMENT.\nYou will always be asked for this log: – when requesting technical assistance from the Techline, – when requesting approval before replacing parts for which approval is compulsory, – to be attached to monitored parts for which reimbursement is requested. The log is needed for warranty  reimbursement, and enables better analysis of the parts removed.\n82D-7 V1 MR-453-X79-82D000$010.mif\nFault finding – List and location of components\n1 UCH 6 Passenger lock\n2 Passenger compartment fuse box 7  Rear left-hand lock\n3 Transponder ring 8 Rear right-hand lock\n4 Tailgate or boot lid lock 9 CPE* button\n5 Driver's lock CPE*: electric central door locking\n82D-8 V1 MR-453-X79-82D000$020.mif\nFault finding – Role of components\nElectric central door locking: The doors can be centrally locked and unlocked using the CPE* button.\nTailgate lock: The tailgate locking and unlocking function is controlled by the UCH.\nFront driver and passenger locks: The front driver and passenger door locking and unlocking command is provided by the UCH.\nTransponder and radiofrequency key: – the  transponder  in the key enables the following signals to be sent to the UCH: – Key identifier signal. – Immobiliser code signal. The transponder is also involved in the Immobiliser function.\nThe radiofrequency  key is used to transmit the key identifier information after pressing the button once. A  radiofrequency wave is sent to the UCH to carry out the user's request if the key is allocated to the vehicle (locking or  unlocking the doors and the tailgate).\nInjection When the authentication messages with the UCH have been exchanged, the injection can be unlocked and  authorise the starting of the engine. The injection system is unlocked and engine starting is authorised as soon as the UCH has authenticated  the injection computer.\nCPE*: electric central door locking.\n82D-9 V1 MR-453-X79-82D000$030.mif\nFault finding – Function\nThe immobiliser function is divided between three coded computers (the UCH, the injection computer and the key).  Communication between the key and the UCH is ensured by the transponder ring through a magnetic field created  between the transponder ring and the key.\nWhen the + After ignition is switched on, the key sends its identifier to the UCH via the transponder ring, located on  the ignition switch. The UCH runs through an authentication procedure with the key via the transponder ring. If the  key is allocated to the vehicle, then operation of the starter motor is authorised and the injection system is unlocked.\nThe injection computer has no reference code in its memory: the code which is transmitted is stored.\nIf the code supplied by the key is not recognised by the UCH, then the system remains locked. The red engine  immobiliser warning light flashes (quickly). The vehicle cannot be started.\nIMPORTANT When the vehicle battery has a low charge, the drop in voltage caused by operating the starter could reactivate the  immobiliser. If the voltage is too low, the engine cannot be started, even by pushing the vehicle.",

The UCH controls the vehicle interior lighting. If a courtesy light is left on, the UCH will cut the lighting supply after  a period of approximately  30 minutes .\nNote: Unlocking can be performed by the UCH, if the airbag computer has detected an impact or if it is faulty (see  88C,  Airbag - Seat belt pretensioners ).\nThe \"top of the range\" version gradually dims the interior lights after one of the vehicle doors has been opened. After  the doors have been closed using the radiofrequency remote control, the interior lights are switched off immediately.\nReplacement keys are assigned to the vehicle VIN when they are ordered from the spare parts department. It is possible in the event of a key being stolen or lost or at the customer's request, for a vehicle key to be de- allocated. It can be reassigned to the same vehicle if necessary.\n82D-11 V1 MR-453-X79-82D000$040.mif\nFault finding – Function 82D\nThe UCH controls the command and supply part of the start-up function and the starting and charging process is  controlled by the UCH. For this function to operate normally, the protection function must have been successfully  completed.\nIMPORTANT: When the vehicle battery has a low charge, the drop in voltage caused by operating the starter could reactivate  the immobiliser. If the voltage is too low, the engine cannot be started, even by pushing the vehicle.\nNote: If several, i.e. three or four, attempts have been made using a key not allocated to the vehicle, the injection  computer locks.

FAULT FINDING PROCEDURE (CONTINUED)\nFault finding problems Disconnecting the connectors and/or manipulating the wiring may temporarily remove the cause of a fault.\nVisual inspection Look for damage under the bonnet and in the passenger compartment. Carefully check the protectors, insulation, and routing of the wiring, as well as the mountings.\nPhysical inspection While manipulating the wiring, use either the  diagnostic tool  to detect a change in status from \"stored\" to \"present\",  or use the multimeter to view the status changes. Make sure that the connectors are properly locked. Apply light pressure to the connectors. Twist the wiring harness.\nChecking earth insulation This check is carried out by measuring the voltage (multimeter in voltmeter mode) between the suspect connection  and the  12 V  or  5 V . The correct measured value is  0 V .\nChecking insulation against + 12 V or + 5 V This check is carried out by measuring the voltage (multimeter in voltmeter mode) between the suspect  connection and the earth. In the first instance, the earth may be taken on the chassis. The correct measured  value should be  0 V\nContinuity check A continuity check is carried out by measuring the resistance (multimeter in ohmmeter mode), with the connectors  disconnected at both ends. The expected result is  1  ΩΩΩΩ  ± 1  ΩΩΩΩ  for every connection. The line must be fully checked,  and the intermediate connections are only included in the method if this saves time during the fault finding  procedure. The continuity check on the multiplex lines must be carried out on both wires. The measured value  should be  1  ΩΩΩΩ  ± 1  ΩΩΩΩ .\nChecking the supply This check may be carried out using a test light ( 21 W  or  5 W  depending on the maximum authorised load).\n85A-6 V1 MR-453-X79-85A000$010.mif\nFault finding – Introduction 85A\n4.2 Checking the connectors\nNote: Carry out each requested check visually.  Do not remove a connector if it is not required.\nNote: Repeated connections and disconnections alter the functionality of the connectors and increase the risk of poor  electrical contact. Limit the number of connections/disconnections as much as possible.\nNote: The check is carried out on the 2 parts of the connection. There may be two types of connection: – Connector/Connector. – Connector/Device.\nVisual inspection of the connection: – Check that the connector is connected correctly and that the male and female parts of the connection are  correctly coupled.\nVisual inspection of the area around the connection: – Check the condition of the mounting (pin, strap, adhesive tape, etc.) if the connectors are attached to the vehicle. – Check that there is no damage to the wiring trim (sheath, foam, adhesive tape, etc.) near the wiring. – Check that there is no damage to the electrical wires at the connector outputs, in particular on the insulating material  (wear, cuts, burns, etc.).\nDisconnect the connector to continue the checks.\nVisual inspection of the plastic casing: – Check that there is no mechanical damage (casing crushed, split, broken, etc.), in particular to the fragile  components (lever, lock, sockets, etc.). – Check that there is no heat damage (casing melted, darker, deformed, etc.). – Check that there are no stains (grease, mud, liquid, etc.).\nVisual inspection of the metal contacts: (The female contact is called CLIP. The male contact is called TAB). – Check that there are no bent contacts (the contact is not inserted correctly and can come out of the back of the  connector). The contact comes out of the connector when the wire is pulled gently. – Check that there is no damage (folded tabs, clips open too wide, blackened or melted contact, etc.). – Check that there is no oxidation on the metal contacts.\n85A-7 V1 MR-453-X79-85A000$010.mif\nFault finding – Introduction 85A\nVisual inspection of the sealing: (Only for watertight connectors) – Check for the seal on the connection (between the 2 parts of the connection). – Check the seal at the back of the connectors: –  For  unit   joints (1 for each wire), check that the unit joints are present on each electrical wire and that they  are correctly positioned in the opening (level with the housing). Check that plugs are present on  openings which are not used. –  For a   grommet  seal (one seal which covers the entire internal surface of the connector), check that the seal  is present. –  For  gel  seals, check for gel in all of the sockets without removing the excess or any protruding sections (it does not  matter if there is gel on the contacts). –  For  hotmelt  sealing (heat-shrink sheath with glue), check that the sheath has contracted correctly on the rear of  the connectors and the electrical wires, and that the hardened glue comes out of the side of the wire. – Check that there is no damage to any of the seals (cuts, burns, significant deformation, etc.).\nIf a fault is detected, consult  Technical Note 6015A, Repairing electrical wiring .\n85A-8 V1 MR-453-X79-85A000$010.mif\nFault finding – Introduction 85A\nIMPORTANT Any fault on a complex system requires thorough fault finding with the appropriate tools.  The FAULT FINDING LOG, which should be completed during the fault finding procedure,  ensures a record is kept of the procedure carried out. It is an essential document when  consulting the manufacturer.\nIT IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL THAT THE FAULT FINDING LOG IS FILLED OUT EVERY TIME IT IS  REQUESTED BY TECHLINE OR THE WARRANTY RETURNS DEPARTMENT.\nYou will always be asked for this log: – when requesting technical assistance from Techline, – for approval requests when replacing parts for which approval is mandatory, – to be attached to monitored parts for which reimbursement is requested. The log is needed for warranty  reimbursement, and enables better analysis of the parts removed.",

This provides the following functions: – intermittent wiper speed, – extended wiper time after washing, – return to park position. In the park position, the switch is closed to  earth , and the UCH receives logical information  0 .\nThis function is only active if  + after ignition feed  is present. When the  + after ignition feed  is switched on, if the windscreen wiper park position is not detected, the wiper  motor relay is held.\nOperation is interrupted in the following cases: – wiper request stopped or no request, –  + after ignition  switched off, – UCH reads park information.\nDetection of the park position should be made on transition and not level, that is, if the wiper stalk is moved from the  intermittent position to the park position while the wiper blade is in the park position and the wiper motor is running,  it will not be stopped until the next reading of the park position. This condition is necessary in order to obtain an exact  park position.\nIntermittent  The intermittent wiper speed function is only active if the  + after ignition  is present and if the switch is in the  intermittent position. The time delay between two wipes is  5 seconds , and this cannot be modified by the  diagnostic tool .\nWhen the windscreen intermittent speed function is activated, the windscreen intermittent speed relay is held by the  UCH until the park position is detected. When the intermittent speed time delay has elapsed, the relay is held again  and the cycle begins again.\n85A-12 V1 MR-453-X79-85A000$040.mif\nFault finding – Function 85A\nRear screen washing/wiping\nThe UCH does not control the rear screen wiper, this function is managed by a direct command.",

Deal with the fault.\nIf the fault is  not confirmed , check: – the electrical lines which correspond to the fault, – the connectors on these lines (corrosion, bent pins, etc.), – the  resistance  of the faulty component, – the condition of the wires (melted or cut insulation, wear).\nThe conformity check is designed to check the statuses and parameters that do not display any faults on the  diagnostic tool  when they are inconsistent. Therefore, this stage is used to:\n– carry out fault finding on faults that do not have a fault display, and which may correspond to a customer complaint, – check that the system is operating correctly and that there is no risk of a fault recurring after repair.\nThis section gives the fault finding procedures for statuses and parameters and the conditions for checking them.\nIf a status is not behaving normally or a parameter is outside permitted tolerance values, you should consult the  corresponding fault finding page.",

    "page_content": "Fault finding – Introduction 87B\n4. FAULT FINDING PROCEDURE (CONTINUED)\nNote: Carry out each requested check visually. Do not remove a connector if it is not required.\nNote: Repeated connections and disconnections alter the functionality of the connectors and increase the risk of poor  electrical contact. Limit the number of connections/disconnections as much as possible.\nNote: The check is carried out on the 2 parts of the connection. There may be two types of connection: – Connector / Connector – Connector / Device\nFault finding problems Disconnecting the connectors and/or manipulating the wiring may temporarily clear the cause of a fault. Electrical measurements of voltage, resistance and insulation are generally correct, especially if the fault is not  present when the analysis is made (stored fault).\nVisual inspection of the connection: • Check that the connector is connected correctly and that the male and female parts of the connection are correctly  coupled.\nVisual inspection of the area around the connection: • Check the condition of the mounting (pin, strap, adhesive tape, etc.) if the connectors are attached to the vehicle. • Check that there is no damage to the wiring trim (sheath, foam, adhesive tape, etc.) near the wiring. • Check that there is no damage to the electrical wires at the connector outputs, in particular on the insulating material  (wear, cuts, burns, etc.).\nDisconnect the connector to continue the checks.\nVisual inspection of the plastic casing: • Check that there is no mechanical damage (casing crushed, cracked, broken, etc.), in particular to the fragile  components (lever, lock, openings, etc.). • Check that there is no heat damage (casing melted, darker, deformed, etc.). • Check that there are no stains (grease, mud, liquid, etc.).\nVisual inspection of the metal contacts: (The female  contact  is called CLIP. The male contact is called TAB). • Check that there are no bent contacts (the contact is not inserted correctly and can come out of the back of the  connector). The spring contact of the connector when the wire is gently pulled. • Check that there is no damage (folded tabs, clips open too wide, blackened or melted contact, etc.). • Check that there is no oxidation on the metal contacts.\n87B-5 V1 MR-453-X79-87B000$010.mif\nFault finding – Introduction 87B\nVisual inspection of the sealing: (Only for watertight connectors) • Check for the seal on the connection (between the 2 parts of the connection). • Check the seal at the back of the connectors: –  For unit  joints (1 for each wire), check that the unit joints are present on each electrical wire and that they are  correctly positioned in the opening (level with the housing). Check that plugs are present on openings which are  not used. – For a  grommet  seal (one seal which covers the entire internal surface of the connector), check that the seal is  present. – For  gel  seals, check for gel in all of the openings without removing the excess or any protruding sections  (it does not matter if there is gel on the contacts). – For  hotmelt  sealing (heat-shrink sheath with glue), check that the sheath has contracted correctly on the rear of  the connectors and electrical wires, and that the hardened glue comes out of the side of the wire. • Check that there is no damage to any of the seals (cuts, burns, significant deformation, etc.).\nIf a fault is detected, repair or replace the wiring (see  Technical Note 6015A, Electrical wiring repair, Wiring:  Precautions for repair ).\nIMPORTANT All faults involving a complex system call for thorough diagnostics with the appropriate tools.  The FAULT FINDING LOG, which should be completed during the fault finding procedure,  ensures a record is kept of the procedure carried out. It is an essential document when  consulting the manufacturer.\nIT IS THEREFORE MANDATORY TO FILL IN A FAULT FINDING LOG EACH TIME IT IS REQUESTED BY  TECHLINE OR THE WARRANTY RETURNS DEPARTMENT.\nYou will always be asked for this log: – when requesting technical assistance from the Techline, – when requesting approval before replacing parts for which approval is compulsory, – to be attached to monitored parts for which reimbursement is requested. The log is needed for – warranty reimbursement, and enables better analysis of the parts removed.",

Use this command each time the computer is replaced. The vehicle identification number is indicated on the manufacturer's plate on the  right-hand side door pillar.\nProcedure for writing the VIN – establish dialogue with the UCH, – select the  \"repair mode\"  menu, – select the  \"Other parameters\"  menu, – select the line  VP004 , – enter the VIN twice, – exit fault finding mode, – switch off the ignition, – wait for the end of  powerlatch , – re-read the VIN using  ID019 VIN Code  in the  Identification  menu for confirmation.\nAFTER REPAIR Carry out a road test followed by a check with the  diagnostic tool .\nV1 MR-453-X79-87B000$110.mif\nFault finding – Interpretation of commands 87B\nUse this command only with a new and blank UCH.\nA new UCH has no immobiliser code and is therefore not assigned to the vehicle; once it is fitted on the vehicle,  it must be programmed to assign it to the vehicle.\nTo carry out this programming, always obtain  a key belonging to the vehicle  (assigned to the old UCH).\nBefore starting this operation, make sure that there are no components likely to interfere with the electromagnetic  field (e.g.: CB (Citizen Band), mobile phone, etc.).\nNote: After only the UCH has been replaced, there are no operations to be performed on the injection computers. The computers keep the same immobiliser code.\nIMPORTANT: When the UCH programming procedure is successfully completed, the UCH is no longer blank and is permanently  assigned to the vehicle. It will not work on another vehicle.\nIMPORTANT: At the end of the programming operation, only remove the key when the  Programming complete  message is  displayed on the screen. Otherwise, the programming will fail and the UCH can no longer be used.\nAFTER REPAIR Repeat the conformity check from the start.\n87B-32 V1 MR-453-X79-87B000$110.mif\nFault finding – Interpretation of commands 87B\nIMPORTANT: Do not interrupt the procedure when it is in progress.

These two wires are called multiplex line H and multiplex line L.\nOn this vehicle, there is only one multiplex network. Depending on the vehicle options, it can include the following  computers: ABS, ESP, torque distributor – ETC, injection, and DP0.\nData is exchanged by the computers on the  multiplex  network at a communication speed of 500 kbit/s.\nIn contrast to standard  multiplex  networks that have two  120   Ω   resistors at the two network terminations, this  network has just one  60  ΩΩΩΩ  resistor.   This  60   Ω   line resistor is located in the injection computer .\n– The purpose of the multiplex network test is to determine the various computers present on the vehicle's multiplex  network as well as the cause of possible inter-computer communication faults.\n– It also serves to determine the functions installed in the vehicle which are often housed in various computers  (distributed functions, e.g.: Air conditioning, Security access, etc.).\n– The multiplex network test can also run fault finding on computers disconnected from the multiplex network;  this provides an overview of the vehicle's electronic layout.\n88B-2 V1 MR-453-X79-88B000$010.mif\nFault finding – Introduction 88B",

    "page_content": "TEMIC AIRBAG Vdiag No.: 18 Computer type  No.: 0000\nFault finding – Function\nThe airbag computer monitors all of the vehicle's restraint devices intended to ensure occupant protection (driver,  front and rear passengers).\nThe computer is designed to carry out the following functions: – detection and confirmation of front longitudinal impacts and/or side impacts, – corresponding activation of the pyrotechnic restraint devices (e.g. inertia reels, airbag), – management of the inhibiting function of the trigger lines and the lateral acceleration sensors, – management and monitoring of the  Airbag fault  and  Airbag Off  warning lights on the instrument panel (wire  connections), – management of the warning lights for the SBR*, – management of the audible function for the SBR*, – management of the radio cut-off for the SBR*, – management of the fault finding signals (signals provided by the fault manager in response to fault finding requests  regarding internal faults or input - output fault finding).\n1. Longitudinal impacts:\nThe detection of front or rear longitudinal impacts takes into account the signals from the internal accelerometers of  the computer.\nA frontal algorithm produces a characterisation of the impact using the sensor signals in order to initiate an adapted  protection. The programs used by other computers that might use this signal are not part of the present functional  description.\nAdditional information, for example the position of the inhibitor key, is used to modify the behaviour of the system  accordingly in order to better meet the protection requirements resulting from the situation which has been identified  and characterised.\nA side algorithm produces a characterisation of the impact using the signals from side sensors and from an internal  sensor in the computer to initiate an adapted protection on the impact side. The programs used by other computers  that might use this signal are not part of the present functional description.\nAdditional information, for example the position of the inhibitor key, can (depending on the configuration used) be  used to modify the behaviour of the system accordingly in order to better meet the protection requirements resulting  from the situation which has been identified and characterised.\nSBR*: Seat Belt Reminder\n88C-15 V1 MR-453-X79-88C000$050.mif\nTEMIC AIRBAG Vdiag No.: 18 Computer type  No.: 0000\nFault finding – Function 88C\n3. Inhibition of passenger trigger lines:\nThis function is managed by the airbag computer, according to the position of the passenger airbag inhibition switch  and taking into account the vehicle context. The change of status of the inhibition switch responds to transverse programming (manufacturer's industry  regulation) that authorises taking it into account  10 seconds  after the vehicle ignition is switched on  (computer supply).\nInhibition programming: – trigger lines inhibited and  Airbag Off  warning light illuminated if switch is  OFF (100   Ω ), – trigger lines authorised if the switch is  ON  ( 400   Ω ), – trigger lines inhibited,  Airbag Fault  and  Airbag Off  warning lights illuminated if a fault is detected, if the switch is  not configured and detected as present, or if there is a change of position not fulfilling the conditions.\nBy default, when the key is in the inhibition position, the following protections and signals are inhibited in the event of  a crash: – front passenger front airbag. – front passenger chest airbag. – SBR* warnings: the inhibition key causes the inhibition of the warning light and buzzer, and deactivates the radio  cut-off warning for the occupant.\nThis remains configurable by the diagnostic procedure except for the SBR* warnings.\nThe passenger front airbag and passenger chest airbag are inhibited when the locking switch is positioned on  OFF   or when  DF028   PASSENGER AIRBAG STATUS INDICATOR LIGHT CIRCUIT  or  DF193   PASSENGER AIRBAG  LOCKING STATUS CHANGE  is present in the computer memory.\n4. Seat belt locking monitoring:\nThis function is managed by the computer (warning light and audible signal): – driver's seat belt buckled (contact open), – driver's seat belt not buckled (contact closed).\n5. Management and monitoring of the airbag warning lights:\nThe airbag computer controls and checks the status of the  Airbag fault  and  Airbag Off  warning lights on the  instrument panel. These signals are exchanged via wire.\nThe  Airbag fault  warning light illuminates for  4 seconds  when the ignition is switched on ( + after ignition ), the time  necessary for the system to be operational after the vehicle is started. It then remains off except under the following  conditions: – detection and recording of an airbag system fault (input - output fault, configuration fault), – a crash has been detected and registered, – if the computer is  crash locked  by a  diagnostic tool , – if the computer must be programmed or reprogrammed.\nThe  Airbag Off  warning light represents the actual inhibition status of the passenger airbags: –  off  = active (switch  ON) , –  illuminated  = passenger airbags inactive (switch  OFF  or detection of a fault on the switch line).\nThe 2 warning lights can be illuminated simultaneously.\nSBR*: Seat Belt Reminder\n88C-16 V1 MR-453-X79-88C000$050.mif\nTEMIC AIRBAG Vdiag No.: 18 Computer type  No.: 0000\nFault finding – Function 88C\n6. Management of fault finding signals.\n– fault finding of internal functions (self-test when switched on, verification of the configuration), – fault finding of external functions (pyrotechnic ignition modules and sensors), – fault finding of the supply, – storage of faults identified when the vehicle is started, while the engine is running, or when the ignition is  switched off, – permanent storage of parameters relating to the crash algorithm and the signals obtained during a crash, – permanent storage of system faults present before a crash, – warning light control.\nThe airbag system components must be configured in accordance with the vehicle equipment criteria.\nAll the inputs and outputs of the airbag computer (ignition modules and sensors) are configurable independently  of one another.\nAny incorrect configuration is detected by the recording of the fault and the illumination of the Airbag fault warning  light: – \"open circuit\" fault if an ignition module (or sensor) is configured, but the component is not connected, – \"configuration\" fault if an ignition module (or sensor) is unconfigured and the component is connected.\n88C-17 V1 MR-453-X79-88C000$050.mif\nTEMIC AIRBAG Vdiag No.: 18 Computer type  No.: 0000\nFault finding – Configuration\nCONFIGURATION/CONFIGURATION READING\n- The configuration reading commands ( LCxxx ) are used to display the current computer configuration  in relation to the trigger lines and sensors installed in the vehicle.\n- The configuration commands ( CFxxx ) are used to adjust the computer configuration to the equipment  actually installed in the vehicle.\n– CONFIGURABLE COMPONENTS for the version with 6 trigger lines\nTrigger lines \"WITH\" or \"WITHOUT\"",
